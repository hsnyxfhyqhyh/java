 1  Glory be to God the Father,
 1     And to Christ the Son,
 1  Glory to the Holy Spirit -
 1     Ever One.
 
 2  As we view the vast creation,
 2     Planned with wondrous skill,
 2  So our hearts would move to worship,
 2     And be still.
 
 3  But, our God, how great Thy yearning
 3     To have sons who love
 3  In the Son e'en now to praise Thee,
 3     Love to prove!
 
 4  'Twas Thy thought in revelation,
 4     To present to men
 4  Secrets of Thine own affections,
 4     Theirs to win.
 
 5  So in Christ, through His redemption
 5     (Vanquished evil powers!)
 5  Thou hast brought, in new creation,
 5     Worshippers!
 
 6  Glory be to God the Father,
 6     And to Christ the Son,
 6  Glory to the Holy Spirit -
 6     Ever One.

 8  Our Father, we would praise Thee now

 8  In spirit and in truth to Thee
 8     True worship we impart.

 1  Thou art love and Thou art light, Lord,
 1     In the Son as life Thou art;
 1  Love expressing, light illum'ning,
 1     Thou dost life to us impart.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 2  Love bespeaks Thy very being,
 2     What Thou dost is shown by light;
 2  Love is inward, light is outward,
 2     Love accompanies the light.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 3  Love by grace is manifested,
 3     And the light by truth is shown;
 3  By Thy love we may enjoy Thee;
 3     By Thy light Thou, Lord, art known.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 4  Thru Thy love, which led to Calvary,
 4     We receive the life of God;
 4  Light our understanding opens,
 4     That we may apply the blood.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 5  Thru Thy love, as life Thou enter'st
 5     Fellowship with Thee to give;
 5  Thru Thy light we take Thy cleansing
 5     And in fellowship may live.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 6  By the light and blood which cleanses,
 6     The anointing we shall know;
 6  Then the life of love Thine essence,
 6     More and more in us will flow.
 
Thou art love! Thou art light!
   In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning
   Thou dost life to us impart.
 
 7  By Thy love we are Thy children,
 7     Abba Father calling Thee;
 7  Light disperses all our darkness,
 7     Till, like Him, Thy Son, we see.
 
O what grace! O what truth!
   Love is seen and light is shown!
We would praise Thee never ceasing,
   Thou by love and light art known!

 1  O God, Thou art transcendent,
 1     The Holy One Thou art!
 1  None other is Thine equal,
 1     Incomp'rable Thou art!
 1  The holiest of the holy
 1     The universe may call!
 1  Thy power and Thy nature
 1     Do far exceed it all!
 
 2  Distinct, unique, and holy,
 2     Not only right and pure;
 2  Not only without defect,
 2     But with perfection more;
 2  For nothing can approach Thee,
 2     Nor e'er Thine equal be;
 2  If aught Thy place hath taken,
 2     'Tis insult unto Thee.
 
 3  The excellent excelling,
 3     The fairest of the fair,
 3  Yet differing from the finest,
 3     For none with Thee compare.
 3  From all the righteous different,
 3     For Thine is absolute;
 3  None beauteous with Thee vying,
 3     For Thine excels repute.
 
 4  Thy holiness transcendent
 4     Thou hast for us prepared,
 4  And this distinctive nature
 4     We have already shared.
 4  We share in Thy transcendence,
 4     Since we Thy nature own;
 4  Thy holy life we follow
 4     Till unto fulness grown.
 
 5  We give Thee praise and worship
 5     For all Thy holiness,
 5  For Thy transcendent nature,
 5     Thine utter peerlessness.
 5  We praise Thee that Thy nature -
 5     Unique, distinct - we share;
 5  This separating nature
 5     Is ours now and fore'er.

 1  Our Father, as the evergreen,
 1     Thou art forever new;
 1  Thou art the ever living Lord,
 1     Thy freshness as the dew.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.
 
 2  O Thou art God, and Thou art "new";
 2     Without Thee all is worn,
 2  But all with Thee is ever fresh,
 2     Though many years have gone.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.
 
 3  Each blessing Thou hast given us
 3     Thy newness doth contain;
 3  Thy covenant, Thy ways are new,
 3     And ever thus remain.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.
 
 4  Now we Thy new creation are
 4     New spirit and new heart;
 4  We're daily from the old renewed,
 4     New life Thou dost impart.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.
 
 5  The earth and heavens will be new
 5     And Thy new city share;
 5  New fruits each month will be supplied,
 5     For all is newness there.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.
 
 6  O Father, Thou art ever new,
 6     And all is new in Thee;
 6  We sing the new eternal song,
 6     New praise we give to Thee.
 
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
   Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
   Thy newness doth unfold.

 1  My Father God, when on Thy vast creation.
 1  The wonders of the heav'n and earth, I gaze.
 1  Things great and small, beyond enumeration,
 1  Which manifest Thy pow'r in untold ways;
 
Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
And this I'll sing through all eternity,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
 
 2  As I enjoy the grace of Thy salvation
 2  And contemplate how Thou Thy Son hast sent,
 2  Who died that we might be Thy new creation,
 2  Thy life expressing to the full extent;
 
Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
And this I'll sing through all eternity,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
 
 3  When in the church, in blest participation,
 3  I see how millions Thine own life possess,
 3  How they are built to form Thy habitation,
 3  Containing Thee, Thy fulness to express;
 
Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
And this I'll sing through all eternity,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
 
 4  As I expect the coming age of fulness
 4  And hope to share the new Jerusalem,
 4  With all the heavens and the earth in newness
 4  And all Thou art expressed in all of them;
 
Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!
And this I'll sing through all eternity,
   How marvelous! How great Thou art!

 1  How faithful and trustworthy too,
 1     My Father God, art Thou;

 1     Thy faithfulness avow.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 2  No turning shadow could there be,
 2     Nor any change with Thee;
 2  As Thou hast been, and now Thou art,
 2     Forever Thou wilt be.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 3  Thy word, as certain as Thyself,
 3     Can never pass away;
 3  Though heav'n and earth shall disappear,
 3     Thy word abides for aye.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 4  Thy gifts without repentance are,
 4     Thy calling is the same;
 4  Thy grace forever lasting is,
 4     Thy mercy as Thy name.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 5  Thy word with Thine own faithfulness
 5     A surety is to me;
 5  By it, with Thy salvation true,
 5     I have the certainty.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 6  If, due to self, I trust Thee not,
 6     Yet Thou art faithful still;
 6  Thou never canst deny Thyself,
 6     Thy word Thou shalt fulfill.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 7  As Thou art faithful to perform
 7     Thy promise and Thy call;
 7  So, feeding on Thy faithfulness,
 7     I take Thyself withal.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.
 
 8  The rainbow round about Thy throne
 8     Thy faithfulness declares;
 8  This attribute forevermore
 8     The holy city bears.
 
How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
   For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
   And ever stands for me.

 1  God our Father, we adore Thee,
 1     For the sake of righteousness;
 1  Thou in Christ hast justified us,
 1     Who our conscience can depress?
 1  Thou art righteous, and art faithful,
 1     On Thy righteousness we stand;
 1  No unrighteousness is in Thee,
 1     None can turn Thy righteous hand.
 
 2  Thou hast laid our sins on Jesus,
 2     By Thy justice He was killed;
 2  All Thy holy law's requirements
 2     For Thy justice He fulfilled.
 2  Recompense from Him receiving,
 2     Thou art fully satisfied;
 2  How couldst Thou, O God most righteous,
 2     Claim it once more from our side?
 
 3  Father God, Thou hast accepted
 3     Jesus as our Substitute;
 3  Judged the Just One for the unjust,
 3     Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
 3  As a proof of perfect justice,
 3     At Thine own right hand He sits;
 3  He, as Thy full satisfaction,
 3     Righteously Thy need befits.
 
 4  Father, through the blood of Jesus
 4     We possess Thy righteousness;
 4  By Thy righteousness protected,
 4     None can shake our steadfastness.
 4  Righteousness of Thine Thou mad'st us,
 4     None can ever us condemn;
 4  We'll forever testify this
 4     In the new Jerusalem.

 1  We praise Thee for Thy righteousness;
 1  Thy justice, Father, we confess,
 1     And fully testify.
 1  Thou art the judge of all mankind,
 1  In Thee injustice none can find,
 1     Nor wrong to Thee apply.
 
 2  O holy Father, righteous One,
 2  Thy righteousness upholds Thy throne,
 2     'Tis a foundation sure.
 2  'Tis through this righteousness of Thine
 2  That reigns in Christ the grace divine,
 2     And peace we thus secure.
 
 3  Thy righteousness has caused Thy Son
 3  To die for us that we be won,
 3     Redemption thus was bought;
 3  Thy righteousness has justified
 3  When Christ's redemption was applied,
 3     Salvation thus was wrought.
 
 4  That Thou might show Thy righteousness,
 4  With Thy forgiveness Thou didst bless
 4     Men in the ancient age;
 4  For Thee Thy righteousness to show,
 4  Remission Thou dost now bestow
 4     On sinners in this age.
 
 5  All people Thou wilt judge one day,
 5  Thy righteousness to all display
 5     By Christ, Thy Son, our Lord;
 5  Yet fast we'll stand, for none can move,
 5  Thy righteousness we'll ever prove,
 5     With grace Thou wilt afford.
 
 6  With justice is Thy kingdom filled,
 6  And peace upon it Thou dost build
 6     With all in harmony;
 6  In the new heaven and new earth
 6  Thy righteousness will be their worth,
 6     As promised, God, by Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  The love of God is greater far
 1     Than tongue or pen can ever tell
 1  It goes beyond the highest star
 1     And reaches to the lowest hell.
 1  The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
 1     God gave His Son to win;
 1  His erring child He reconciled
 1     And pardoned from his sin.
 
O love of God, how rich and pure!
   How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
   The saints' and angels' song.
 
 2  When hoary time shall pass away,
 2     And earthly kingdoms fall;
 2  When men who here refuse to pray,
 2     On rocks and hills and mountains call;
 2  God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
 2     All measureless and strong;
 2  Redeeming grace to Adam's race -
 2     The saints' and angels' song.
 
O love of God, how rich and pure!
   How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
   The saints' and angels' song.
 
 3  Could we with ink the ocean fill,
 3     And were the skies of parchment made;
 3  Were every stalk on earth a quill,
 3     And every man a scribe by trade;
 3  To write the love of God above
 3     Would drain the ocean dry;
 3  Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
 3     Though stretched from sky to sky.
 
O love of God, how rich and pure!
   How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
   The saints' and angels' song.

 1  What was it, blessed God,
 1  Led Thee to give Thy Son,
 1  To yield Thy Well-beloved
 1  For us by sin undone?
 1  'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus,
 1  To give Thy Well-beloved for us.
 
 2  What led Thy Son, O God,
 2  To leave Thy throne on high,
 2  To shed His precious blood,
 2  To suffer and to die?
 2  'Twas love - unbounded love to us
 2  Led Him to die and suffer thus.
 
 3  What moved Thee to impart
 3  Thy Spirit from above,
 3  Therewith to fill our heart
 3  With heavenly peace and love?
 3  'Twas love - unbounded love to us
 3  Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
 
 4  What love to Thee we owe,
 4  Our God, for all Thy grace!
 4  Our hearts may well o'erflow
 4  In everlasting praise!
 4  Make us, O God, to praise Thee thus
 4  For all Thy boundless love to us.

 1  What love Thou hast bestowed on us,
 1     We thank Thee from our heart;
 1  Our Father, we would worship Thee
 1     And praise for all Thou art.
 
 2  Thy heart Thou hast revealed to us,
 2     Made known th' eternal will;
 2  Within the Son Thou hast come forth,
 2     Thy purpose to fulfill.
 
 3  Thou gavest Thy beloved Son
 3     In love to come and die,
 3  That we may be Thy many sons,
 3     As heirs with Him, made nigh.
 
 4  Through Him we have Thy very life
 4     And Thou our Father art;
 4  Thy very nature, all Thyself,
 4     Thou dost to us impart.
 
 5  Thy Spirit into ours has come
 5     That we may "Abba" cry;
 5  Of Spirit born, with Spirit sealed,
 5     To be transformed thereby.
 
 6  The many sons to glory brought
 6     Is Thine eternal goal,
 6  And to Thy Son's own image wrought,
 6     Thou wilt conform the whole.
 
 7  Throughout Thy transformation work
 7     Thou dost direct each one,
 7  From glory unto glory bring
 7     Until the work is done.
 
 8  What love Thou, Father, hast bestowed;
 8     We'll ever grateful be;
 8  We'll worship Thee forevermore
 8     And praise unceasingly.

 1  All that we were - our sin, our guilt,
 1     Our death - was all our own:
 1  All that we are we owe to Thee,
 1     Thou God of grace alone.
 
 2  Thy mercy found us in our sins,
 2     And gave us to believe;
 2  Then, in believing, peace we found,
 2     And in Thy Christ we live.
 
 3  All that we are, as saints on earth,
 3     All that we hope to be,
 3  When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
 3     We owe it all to Thee.
 
 4  O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,
 4     Whoe'er can Thee repay?
 4  Thy love is past man's finding out,
 4     Thy grace no man can say.
 
 5  But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,
 5     More clearly may I see,
 5  That I may e'er more fully know
 5     How much I owe to Thee.
 
 6  But if man's heart should e'er suppose
 6     He could repay Thy love,
 6  It only means he nothing knows
 6     Of love, all loves above.
 
 7  So may we never bargains make
 7     With that dear love of Thine:
 7  The love that made Thine heart once break,
 7     Whoe'er that love could win?
 
 8  Then nevermore suggest return,
 8     His love is far too high;
 8  But let our hearts with rapture burn
 8     That He for us should die.
 
 9  O Father God, we owe Thee all!
 9     All that we are and have!
 9  With grateful thanks before Thee fall,
 9     'Tis all that we can give.

 1  We bow and worship, Father, here
 1  And marvel at Thy wondrous love.
 1  O what is man that Thou shouldst deign
 1  To him such boundless grace to prove!
 
 2  We praise Thee for Thy heart's intent
 2  That man Thy likeness should Possess,
 2  That with Thy life and nature filled
 2  Thine image he should manifest.
 
 3  Man in Thine image Thou didst make,
 3  To him authority didst give;
 3  Thyself presenting as his life,
 3  That by Thy riches he might live.
 
 4  To enter man Thou dost desire,
 4  With him to mingle thru Thy grace,
 4  That man may be transformed and built
 4  To be Thy worthy dwelling place.
 
 5  Tho' man did fall, Thou didst not leave
 5  Thy heart's intent, but Thou didst move;
 5  Redeeming man to bring him back,
 5  Thou didst Thy love and wisdom prove.
 
 6  In Christ Thou didst Thyself reveal,
 6  Who died and rose, redemption wrought;
 6  In Spirit Thou hast entered man
 6  And to him life and grace hast brought.
 
 7  My spirit is Thy holiest place,
 7  Thy throne of grace is founded there;
 7  Thou wouldst that we in spirit come
 7  To burn the incense thru our prayer.
 
 8  Such grace is like a river full
 8  Which from the throne of grace doth come;
 8  It floweth thru, transforming us,
 8  And builds us up to be Thy home.
 
 9  Receiving of Thy matchless grace,
 9  We marvel at Thy gift so free;
 9  With grateful hearts for Thy great love,
 9  In spirit now we worship Thee.

 1  Father, long before creation,
 1     Thou hadst chosen us in love;
 1  And that love, so deep, so moving,
 1     Draws us close to Christ above,
 1  And will keep us, and will keep us,
 1     Firmly fixed in Christ alone,
 1     Firmly fixed in Christ alone.
 
 2  Though the world may change its fashion,
 2     Yet our God is e'er the same;
 2  His compassion and His cov'nant
 2     Through all ages will remain.
 2  God's own children, God's own children,
 2     Must forever praise His name,
 2     Must forever praise His name.
 
 3  God's compassion is my story,
 3     Is my boasting all the day;
 3  Mercy free and never failing
 3     Moves my will, directs my way.
 3  God so loved us, God so loved us,
 3     That His only Son He gave,
 3     That His only Son He gave.
 
 4  Loving Father, now before Thee
 4     We will ever praise Thy love;
 4  And our song will sound unceasing
 4     Till we meet Thy Son above,
 4  Giving glory, giving glory,
 4     To our God and to the Lamb,
 4     To our God and to the Lamb.

 1  Father, 'twas Thy love that knew us
 1     Earth's foundation long before:
 1  That same love to Jesus drew us

 1  And will keep us, and will keep us,
 1     Safely now, and evermore,

 3  God of love, our souls adore Thee!
 3     We would still Thy grace proclaim,
 3  Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
 3     And in glory praise Thy name;
 3  Praise and worship, praise and worship
 3     Be to God and to the Lamb!
 3     Be to God and to the Lamb!

 1  To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
 1  So Loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
 1  Who yielded His life our redemption to win,
 1  And opened the life-gate that all may go in.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the earth hear His voice:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.
 
 2  Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
 2  To every believer the promise of God;
 2  The vilest offender who truly believes,
 2  That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the earth hear His voice:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.
 
 3  Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
 3  And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
 3  But purer, and higher, and greater will be
 3  Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the earth hear His voice:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
   Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.

 1  By Thee, O God, invited,
 1     We look unto the Son,
 1  In whom Thy heart delighted,
 1     Who all Thy will hath done;
 1  And by the one chief treasure
 1     Thy bosom freely gave,
 1  Thine own pure love we measure,
 1     Thy willing mind to save.
 
 2  O God of mercy - Father!
 2     The one unchanging claim,
 2  The brightest hopes, we gather
 2     From Christ's most precious name:
 2  What always sounds so sweetly
 2     In Thine unwearied ear,
 2  Has freed our souls completely
 2     From all our guilt and fear.
 
 3  The trembling sinner feareth
 3     That God can ne'er forget;
 3  But one full payment cleareth
 3     His memory of all debt.
 3  When nought beside could free us,
 3     Or set our souls at large,
 3  The death of God's Beloved
 3     Secured a full discharge.
 
 4  No wrath God's heart retaineth
 4     To usward who believe;
 4  No dread in ours remaineth
 4     As we His love receive;
 4  Returning sons He kisses,
 4     And with His robe invests;
 4  His perfect love dismisses
 4     All terror from our breasts.

 1  "Abba, Father," we approach Thee
 1     In our Savior's precious name.
 1  We, Thy children, here assembling,
 1     Now the promised blessing claim.
 1  From our guilt His blood has washed us,
 1     'Tis through Him our souls draw nigh,
 1  And Thy Spirit too has taught us
 1     "Abba, Father," thus to cry.
 
 2  Once as prodigals we wandered,
 2     In our folly, far from Thee;
 2  But Thy grace, o'er sin abounding,
 2     Rescued us from misery.
 2  Clothed in garments of salvation
 2     At Thy table is our place;
 2  We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,
 2     In the riches of Thy grace.
 
 3  Thou the prodigal hast pardoned,
 3     "Kissed us" with a Father's love;
 3  "Killed the fatted calf," and made us
 3     Fit Thy purpose to approve
 3  "It is meet," we hear Thee saying,
 3     "We should merry be and glad;
 3  I have found My once-lost children,
 3     Now they live who once were dead."
 
 4  "Abba, Father," we adore Thee,
 4     While the hosts in heaven above
 4  E'en in us now learn the wonders
 4     Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love.
 4  Soon before Thy throne assembled,
 4     All Thy children shall proclaim
 4  Abba's love shown in redemption,
 4     And how full is Abba's name!

 1  O Holy Father, who in tender love
 1     Didst give Thine only Son for us to die,
 1  The while He pleads at Thy right hand above,
 1     We in one Spirit now with faith draw nigh;
 1  And, as we eat this bread and drink this wine,
 1     Plead His once offered sacrifice Divine.
 
 2  We are not worthy to be called Thy sons,
 2     Nor gather up the fragments of Thy feast;
 2  Yet look on us, Thy sorrowing contrite ones,
 2     On us in Him our Advocate and Priest,
 2  Whose robe is fringed with mercy's golden bells,
 2     Whose breastplate fathomless compassion tells.
 
 3  Oh, hear us, for Thou always hearest Him;
 3     Behold us sprinkled with His precious blood;
 3  And from between the shadowing cherubim
 3     Shine forth, and grant us by this heav'nly food
 3  Foretastes of coming glory, and meanwhile
 3     A Father's blessing and a Father's smile.
 
 4  And, Father, ere we leave Thy mercy-throne,
 4     Bound by these sacred pledges, yet most free,
 4  We give our hearts, and not our hearts alone,
 4     But all we are and all we have to Thee;
 4  Glad free-will offerings all our pilgrim days,
 4     Hereafter an eternity of praise.

 1  Abba, Father! We adore Thee,
 1     Humbly now our homage pay;
 1  'Tis Thy children's bliss to know Thee,
 1     None but children "Abba" say.
 1  This high honor we inherit,
 1     Thy free gift through Jesus' blood;
 1  God the Spirit, with our spirit,
 1     Witnesseth we're sons of God.
 
 2  Thine own purpose gave us being'
 2     When in Christ, in that vast plan,
 2  Thou in Christ didst choose Thy people
 2     E'en before the world began.
 2  Oh, what love Thou, Father, bore us!
 2     Oh, how precious in Thy sight!
 2  When to Thine own Son Thou gav'st us,
 2     To Thy Son, Thy soul's delight.
 
 3  Though our nature's fall in Adam
 3     Shut us wholly out from God,
 3  Thine eternal counsel brought us
 3     Nearer still, through Jesus' blood;
 3  For in Him we found redemption,
 3     Grace and glory in Thy Son;
 3  O the height and depth of mercy!
 3     Christ and His redeemed are one.
 
 4  Hence, through all the changing seasons,
 4     Trouble, sickness, sorrow, woe,
 4  Nothing changeth Thine affections,
 4     Love divine shall bring us through;
 4  Soon shall all Thy blood-bought children
 4     Round the throne their anthems raise,
 4  And, in songs of rich salvation,
 4     Shout to Thine eternal praise.

 7  Declaring all He is to man,
 7     No more is God concealed.
 
We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,

His glory and His character
   Are all revealed by Thee.

 1  Thou art the everlasting Word,
 1     The Father's only Son,
 1  God manifestly seen and heard,
 1     And heav'n's beloved One:
 1  Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
 1  In Thee God's fulness find we now.
 
 2  In Thee most perfectly expressed
 2     The Father's glories shine;
 2  Of the full Deity possessed,
 2     Eternally divine:
 2  Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
 2  In Thee God's fulness find we now.
 
 3  True image of the Infinite,
 3     Whose essence is concealed;
 3  Brightness of uncreated light;
 3     The heart of God revealed:
 3  Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
 3  In Thee God's fulness find we now.
 
 4  But the, high mysteries of Thy Name
 4     An angel's grasp transcend;
 4  The Father only, glorious claim!
 4     The Son can comprehend:
 4  Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
 4  In Thee God's fulness find we now.
 
 5  Throughout the universe of bliss,
 5     The center, Thou, and sun;
 5  Th' eternal theme of praise is this,
 5     To heav'n's beloved One:
 5  Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
 5  In Thee God's fulness find we now.

 1  O Lord, Thou art the Son of man,
 1  Our human nature Thou didst take;
 1  Begotten of a virgin true,
 1  Of flesh and blood Thou didst partake.
 
 2  In bondman's form, with lowliness,
 2  Thou walkedst on this earth of woe;
 2  The human living Thou didst have
 2  And all its suff'rings undergo.
 
 3  Born in a manger as a babe,
 3  Thou wast a child among the poor;
 3  Thou as a carpenter didst work,
 3  And e'en an outlaw's death endure.
 
 4  Then Thou wast raised up from the dead,
 4  Still with the human nature true;
 4  And as a man in form divine,
 4  Thou didst ascend to heaven too.
 
 5  Now over all, and on the throne,
 5  Thou, still a man, art glorified;
 5  A man with God in light divine
 5  With whom our God is satisfied.
 
 6  In glory Thou wilt come again,
 6  Still as a man appearing then;
 6  As King of kings, with pow'r divine,
 6  With human nature seen by men.
 
 7  Thou, as the center of all things,
 7  In the new heav'n and earth shalt be,
 7  Forever as the One divine,
 7  Existing in humanity.

 1  Dear Lord Jesus, we adore Thee,
 1     "Seed of woman" Thou became;
 1  Of the virgin wast begotten,
 1     Called e'en with a human name.
 1  Taking thus the human nature,
 1     Thou as man the serpent trod;
 1  By the Cross his head Thou bruised
 1     And fulfilled the plan of God.
 
Lord, we see Thy glory,
Shown in human beauty,
Full of splendor, manifested
         In humanity.
 
 2  As a man, by incarnation,
 2     Flesh and blood didst Thou partake
 2  To destroy the devil, Satan,
 2     In our stead and for our sake.
 2  With the name of Jesus given
 2     And Emmanuel called too,
 2  Thou becam'st our precious Savior,
 2     Bringing us salvation true.
 
Lord, we see Thy glory,
Shown in human beauty,
Full of splendor, manifested
         In humanity.
 
 3  Thou, "Last Adam" wast entitled,
 3     And wast called the "second man",
 3  Head of all the new creation,
 3     Better than the first man.
 3  On this earth in life and conduct
 3     Thou indeed wast Son of man;
 3  Now in heaven with this nature
 3     Thou dost still appear as man.
 
Lord, we see Thy glory,
Shown in human beauty,
Full of splendor, manifested
         In humanity.
 
 4  In the time which God appointed
 4     Thou wilt come, dear Lord, again,
 4  With the glory of the Father,
 4     Still appearing as a man.
 4  Even on the throne of judgment
 4     Son of man Thou still wilt be;
 4  And with this, our human nature,
 4     Thou forevermore wilt be.
 
Lord, we see Thy glory,
Shown in human beauty,
Full of splendor, manifested
         In humanity.

 2  O loving wisdom of our God,

 3  O wisest love! That flesh and blood

 5  The double agony in man
 5     For man should undergo.
 
 6  And in the garden secretly,
 6     And on the cross on high,

 1  How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
 1     In a believer's ear!
 1  It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
 1     And drives away his fear.
 
 2  It makes the wounded spirit whole,
 2     And calms the troubled breast;
 2  'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
 2     And to the weary rest.
 
 3  Dear Name! The Rock on which we build;
 3     Our shield and hiding-place;
 3  Our never-failing treasury, filled
 3     With boundless stores of grace.
 
 4  Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,
 4     Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
 4  Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
 4     Accept the praise we bring.
 
 5  Weak is the effort of our heart,
 5     And cold our warmest thought;
 5  But when we see Thee as Thou art,
 5     We'll praise Thee as we ought.
 
 6  Till then we would Thy love proclaim

 1  Lord, Thy Name is called Jesus,

 1  Thou art our Jehovah-Savior,

 2  Thou as "Christ" art also titled,

 2  Thou art truly God's anointed,
 2     Even from eternity.
 2  Thou, O Lord, art God's Messiah;
 2     God appointed Thee in love,
 2  That Thou might fulfill His purpose
 2     And to all His glory prove.
 
 3  Thou art also, called "Emmanuel";

 4  How we treasure all Thy names, Lord,
 4     How much they to us unfold;
 4  All their worth and all their sweetness
 4     We in love will ever hold.
 4  Precious Savior, we adore Thee,
 4     Worship unto Thee we bring;
 4  Our Emmanuel we exalt Thee,

 1  Jesus, the name high over all,
 1     In hell, or earth, or sky:
 1  Angels and men before it fall,
 1     And devils fear and fly.
 
 2  Jesus, the name to sinners dear,
 2     The name to sinners giv'n;
 2  It scatters all their guilty fear,
 2     It brings them peace of heav'n.
 
 3  Jesus the prisoner's fetters breaks,
 3     And bruises Satan's head;
 3  Pow'r into strengthless souls He speaks,
 3     And life into the dead.
 
 4  Oh, that the world might taste and see,
 4     The riches of His grace!
 4  The arms of love that compass me,
 4     Would all mankind embrace.
 
 5  Him as my righteousness I show,
 5     His saving truth proclaim:
 5  'Tis all my business here below,
 5     To cry, Behold the Lamb!
 
 6  Happy, if with my latest breath
 6     I may but gasp His name:
 6  Preach Him to all, and cry in death,
 6     "Behold, behold the Lamb!"

 1  There is a name to Jesus given,
 1     His matchless love its accents tell;
 1  For it declares: He is my Brother,
 1     And this His name - Emmanuel!
 1  The Lord, by angels worshiped yonder,
 1     Has stooped to earth with men to dwell,
 1  Incarnate God, and man forever -
 1     Our own beloved Emmanuel.
 
 2  There is a name that's still more precious,
 2     That stirs our hearts with fondest love:
 2  It is the charming name of Jesus,
 2     The name all other names above.
 2  It tells me that He is my Savior
 2     From sin and sickness and the grave.
 2  I love the precious name of Jesus,
 2     For I am one He came to save!
 
 3  Though dear to us the name of Jesus,
 3     The name of Christ is higher still!
 3  It tells of Him who dwells within us,
 3     Our old heart to renew and fill.
 3  It tells me of the Spirit's fullness,
 3     It brings the pow'r of Pentecost.
 3  O blessed Christ, anoint me also,
 3     And fill me with the Holy Ghost!

 1  Jesus, Name of matchless splendor!
 1     Name all other names above!
 1  Glorious Son of God incarnate,
 1     King of kings, and Lord of love!
 
 2  Name that to our hearts is nearest,
 2     Here the stricken soul doth hide;
 2  Name that to our hearts is dearest,

 3  "Call Him Jesus!" He shall save us

 5  Jesus! The triumphant music
 5     Of the bright angelic throng.
 
 6  Earth to Him her face upraises,

 6  Heaven resounds with Jesus' praises,

 1  In the Name of Jesus
 1     Every knee shall bow,
 1  Every tongue confess Him
 1     King of glory now;
 1  'Tis the Father's pleasure
 1     We should call Him Lord,
 1  Who from the beginning
 1     Was the Mighty Word.
 
 2  At His voice creation
 2     Sprang at once to sight:
 2  All the angel faces,
 2     All the hosts of light,
 2  Thrones and dominations,
 2     Stars upon their way,
 2  All the heav'nly orders,
 2     In their great array.
 
 3  Humbled for a season,
 3     To receive a Name
 3  From the lips of sinners
 3     Unto whom He came,
 3  Faithfully He bore it
 3     Spotless to the last,
 3  Brought it back victorious,
 3     When from death He passed;
 
 4  Bore it up triumphant,
 4     With its human light,
 4  Through all ranks of creatures,
 4     To the central height;
 4  To the throne of Godhead,
 4     To the Father's breast,
 4  Filled it with the glory
 4     Of that perfect rest.
 
 5  Name Him, brothers, name Him,
 5     With love strong as death,
 5  But with awe and wonder,
 5     And with bated breath;
 5  He is God the Savior,
 5     He is Christ the Lord,
 5  Ever to be worshiped,
 5     Trusted, and adored.
 
 6  In your hearts enthrone Him;
 6     There let Him subdue
 6  All that is not holy,
 6     All that is not true;
 6  Crown Him as your Captain
 6     In temptation's hour;
 6  Let His will enfold you
 6     In its light and power.
 
 7  Brothers, this Lord Jesus
 7     Shall return again,
 7  With His Father's glory,
 7     With His angel train;
 7  For all wreaths of empire
 7     Meet upon His brow,
 7  And our hearts confess Him
 7     King of glory now.

 8  Thou art resurrection power,
 8  Thou the conqu'ror in hell's hour;
 8  Thou dost us with might empower
 8        Over all to reign.
 
 9  Living water, food supply, Lord,
 9  Thou Thyself art, and didst die, Lord,
 9  All our want to satisfy, Lord;
 9        Now we feast on Thee.
 
 10  Thou the Shepherd and Physician,
 10  Thou hast healed our sick condition;
 10  Comfort, guide, protect - Thy mission;
 10        Thou dost care for us.
 
 11  Priest and King Thou art fore'er, Lord;
 11  Into God we're brought, and there, Lord,
 11  Thine authority we share, Lord;
 11        What an honored place!
 
 12  Thou our Hope and our Redemption,
 12  Thou wilt change our old creation,
 12  Make of Thee a duplication,
 12        Thus Thyself express.
 
 13  Thou our Joy, our Peace, our Glory;
 13  Truth, and Grace, the Rock, the Life-tree,
 13  Building, Mountain, Sun, and Shield - we
 13        Ne'er can tell it all.
 
 14  What Thou art - eternal, boundless,
 14  Full and perfect, rich, exhaustless -
 14  Meets our need to utter fullness
 14        And from us o'erflows.

 1     Join all the glorious names
 1     Of wisdom, love, and pow'r,
 1     That mortals ever knew,
 1     That angels ever bore;
 1  All are too mean to speak His worth,
 1  Too mean to set my Savior forth.
 
 2     Great Prophet of my God,
 2     My tongue would bless Thy name;
 2     By Thee the joyful news
 2     Of our salvation came;
 2  The joyful news of sins forgiv'n,
 2  Of death annulled, and Thy life giv'n.
 
 3     Jesus, my great High Priest,
 3     Offered His blood, and died;
 3     My guilty conscience seeks
 3     No sacrifice beside:
 3  His pow'rful blood did me redeem,
 3  'Tis worthy of my heart's esteem.
 
 4     I love my Shepherd's voice:
 4     His watchful eye shall keep
 4     My wand'ring soul among
 4     The thousands of His sheep:
 4  He feeds His flock, He calls their names,
 4  His bosom bears the tender lambs.
 
 5     My Savior and my Lord,
 5     My Conqu'ror and my King,
 5     Thy scepter and Thy sword,
 5     Thy reigning grace I sing:
 5  Thine is the pow'r; behold I sit
 5  In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.

 1  Down from His glory,
 1     Ever living story,
 1  My God and Savior came,
 1     And Jesus was His name.
 1  Born in a manger,
 1     To His own a stranger,
 1  A Man of sorrows, tears and agony.
 
O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my Savior,
And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.
 
 2  What condescension,
 2     Bringing us redemption;
 2  That in the dead of night,
 2     Not one faint hope in sight,
 2  God, gracious, tender,
 2     Laid aside His splendor,
 2  Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.
 
O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my Savior,
And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.
 
 3  Without reluctance,
 3     Flesh and blood His substance
 3  He took the form of man,
 3     Revealed the hidden plan.
 3  O glorious myst'ry,
 3     Sacrifice of Calv'ry,
 3  And now I know Thou art the great "I AM."
 
O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
The great Creator became my Savior,
And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.

 2  Christ, by highest heav'n adored,

 2  Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
 2     Hail th' incarnate Deity!
 2  Pleased as man with man to dwell,

 3     Hail the Sun of righteousness!
 3  Light and life to all He brings,
 3     Ris'n with healing in His wings:
 3  Mild He lays His glory by,
 3     Born that man no more may die;
 3  Born to raise the sons of earth;
 3     Born to give them second birth.
 
 4  Come, Desire of nations, come!
 4     Fix in us Thy humble home:
 4  Rise, the woman's conjuring seed,
 4     Bruise in us the serpent's head;
 4  Adam's likeness now efface,
 4     Stamp Thine image in its place:
 4  Final Adam from above,
 4     Reinstate us in Thy love.

 1  O come, all ye faithful! Joyfully triumphant,
 1  To Bethlehem hasten now with glad accord;
 1  Lo! In a manger lies the God Almighty;
 
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
   Christ the Lord!
 
 2  Raise, raise choirs of angels, songs of loudest triumph,
 2  Through heaven's high arches be your praises poured:
 2  Now to our God be glory in the highest;
 
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
   Christ the Lord!
 
 3  Amen! Lord, we bless Thee, born for our salvation!
 3  O Jesus! forever be Thy Name adored;
 3  Word of the Father, late in flesh appearing;
 
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
   Christ the Lord!

 1  Though Thou art God, most glorious, high,
 1  Thou in the flesh to us came nigh,
 1  A lowly man become thereby;
 1     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 2  Glory divine was put away
 2  Under the tent of flesh to stay,
 2  No outward beauty to display;
 2     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 3  Thou art a root from out dry ground,
 3  Thou wast the Man of sorrows found,
 3  Hated, despised by man around;
 3     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 4  Gentle and lowly is Thy heart,
 4  Willing to suffer all Thou art,
 4  To God and man complaining not;
 4     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 5  Thou as a man art tender, sweet,
 5  Balanced in every way, complete,
 5  Meal-offering to the Father meet;
 5     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 6  Doing the Father's will Thy prize,
 6  Never accepting Satan's lies,
 6  None like Thyself, so faithful, wise;
 6     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 7  For Thine obedience to God's will,
 7  Willing to suffer deathly ill,
 7  E'en on the Cross my place to fill,
 7     Lord, I remember Thee!
 
 8  Therefore hath God exalted Thee,
 8  Given Thee glory, majesty,
 8  Heaven and earth will bow the knee;
 8     Lord, I worship Thee!

 1  O Lord! When we the path retrace
 1     Which Thou on earth hast trod,
 1  To men Thy wondrous love and grace,
 1     Thy faithfulness to God;
 
 2  Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
 2     Proved stronger than the grave;
 2  The very spear that pierced
 2     Thy side Drew forth the blood to save;
 
 3  Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,
 3     Thy works were ever good;
 3  Although midst sorrows all Thy life,
 3     Thou spak'st no murmuring word.
 
 4  Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
 4     'Mid darkness only light,
 4  Thou didst Thy Father's name confess,
 4     And in His will delight;
 
 5  Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
 5     Or, suffering, shame, and loss,
 5  Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,
 5     Led only to the cross.
 
 6  We wonder at Thy lowly mind,
 6     And fain would like Thee be,
 6  And all our rest and pleasure find
 6     In learning, Lord, of Thee.

 1  How beauteous were the marks divine,

 1  In wondrous love, O Son of God!
 
 2  O who like Thee, so mild, so bright,

 2  O who like Thee did ever go
 2  So patient, through a world of woe?

 3  So meek, so lowly, yet so high,
 3  So glorious in humility?
 
 4  And death, that sets the prisoner free,
 4  Was pang, and scoff, and scorn to Thee;
 4  Yet love through all Thy torture glowed,
 4  And mercy with Thy life-blood flowed.
 
 5  O wondrous Lord, my soul would be
 5  Still more and more conformed to Thee,
 5  And learn of Thee, the lowly One,
 5  And like Thee, all my journey run.

 1  Lord, accept our feeble song!
 1  Pow'r and praise to Thee belong;
 1  We would all Thy grace record,
 1  Holy, gracious, loving Lord!
 
 2  Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,
 2  Thence is all Thy people's hope;
 2  Thou wast poor, that we might be
 2  Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.
 
 3  Wherefore Thou high heaven didst spurn?
 3  Wherefore Thou to earth didst turn?
 3  Why leave heav'n to come to earth
 3  Lonely, scorned, e'en suffering death?
 
 4  Thou in heav'n - the glorious One!
 4  Thou on earth - the outcast Man!
 4  Though this suffering Thou didst know,
 4  Love would come to bear our woe.
 
 5  When we think of love like this,
 5  Joy and shame our hearts possess;
 5  Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus;
 5  Shame, for such returns from us.
 
 6  Yet we hope the day to see
 6  When from every hindrance free,
 6  When to Thee, in glory, brought,
 6  We shall serve Thee as we ought.
 
 7  Now, O Lord, we wait for Thee,
 7  Wait "the blessed hope" to see.
 7  May we ever for Thee live,
 7  Till Thy saints Thou dost receive.

 1  It was alone the Savior prayed
 1     In dark Gethsemane;
 1  Alone He drained the bitter cup
 1     And suffered there for me.
 
Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.
 
 2  It was alone the Savior stood
 2     In Pilate's judgment hall;
 2  Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
 2     Forsaken thus by all.
 
Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.
 
 3  Alone upon the cross He hung
 3     That others He might save;
 3  Forsaken then by God and man.
 3     Alone, His life He gave.
 
Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.
 
 4  Can you reject such matchless love?
 4     Can you His claim disown?
 4  Come, give your all in gratitude,
 4     Nor leave Him thus alone.
 
Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.

 1  O dearest Lord, what law hast Thou e'er broken
 1  That such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?
 1  Of what misdeed hast Thou to make confession -
 1              What dark transgression?
 
 2  They crown Thy head with thorns, they smite, they scourge Thee;
 2  With cruel mockings to the cross they urge Thee;
 2  They give Thee gall to drink, they still decry Thee;
 2              They crucify Thee.
 
 3  What punishment so strange is suffered yonder?
 3  The shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander;
 3  The Master pays the debt His servants owe Him,
 3              Who would not know Him.
 
 4  The sinless Son of God must die in sadness;
 4  The sinful child of man may live in gladness;
 4  Man forfeited His life and is acquitted -
 4              God is committed.
 
 5  O mighty King, no time can dim Thy glory!
 5  How shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?
 5  How shall I find some worthy gift to proffer?
 5              What dare I offer?
 
 6  I'll think upon Thy mercy without ceasing;
 6  That earth's vain joys no more to me be pleasing;
 6  To do Thy will shall be my sole endeavor
 6              Henceforth forever.

 1  Lord, we treasure with affection
 1  All Thy path of sorrow here,
 1  And those closing scenes of anguish

Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
Give Thee glory for the life we gain!
 
 2  Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,
 2  Deeper far than thought can reach;
 2  Grief intense and suff'rings holy,
 2  Far beyond all tongues to teach.
 
Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
Give Thee glory for the life we gain!
 
 3  None could follow there, blest Savior,
 3  When redemption's work was done;

Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
Give Thee glory for the life we gain!

Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  O Christ, what burdens bow'd Thy head!
 1     Our load was laid on Thee;
 1  Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
 1     Didst bear all ill for me.
 1  A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
 1     Now there's no load for me.
 
 2  Death and the curse were in our cup,
 2     O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!
 2  But Thou hast drained the last dark drop -
 2     'Tis empty now for me.
 2  That bitter cup - love drank it up;
 2     Now blessings' draught for me.
 
 3  Jehovah lifted up His rod,
 3     O Christ, it fell on Thee!
 3  Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
 3     There's not one stroke for me.
 3  Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
 3     Thy bruising healeth me.
 
 4  The tempest's awful voice was heard,
 4     O Christ, it broke on Thee!
 4  Thy open bosom was my ward,
 4     It braved the storm for me.
 4  Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
 4     Now cloudless peace for me.
 
 5  Jehovah bade His sword awake,
 5     O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!
 5  Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
 5     Thy heart its sheath must be -
 5  All for my sake, my peace to make;
 5     Now sleeps that sword for me.
 
 6  For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
 6     And I have died in Thee;
 6  Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied,
 6     And now Thou liv'st in me.
 6  When purified, made white, and tried,
 6     Thy glory then for me!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  My song is love unknown,
 1     My Savior's love to me;
 1  Love to the loveless shown,
 1     That they might lovely be.
 1        O who am I,
 1        That for my sake
 1        My Lord should take
 1        Frail flesh, and die?
 
 2  He came from His blest throne
 2     Salvation to bestow;
 2  But men made strange, and none
 2     The longed-for Christ would know:
 2        But oh, my Friend,
 2        My Friend indeed,
 2        Who at my need
 2        His life did spend.
 
 3  Sometimes they strew His way,
 3     And His sweet praises sing;
 3  Resounding all the day
 3     Hosannas to their King:
 3        Then "Crucify!"
 3        Is all their breath,
 3        And for His death
 3        They thirst and cry.
 
 4  They rise and needs will have
 4     My dear Lord made away;
 4  A murderer they save '
 4     The Prince of life they slay.
 4        Yet cheerful He
 4        To suffering goes,
 4        That He His foes
 4        From thence might free.
 
 5  In life, no house, no home
 5     My Lord on earth might have;
 5  In death, no friendly tomb,
 5     But what a stranger gave.
 5        What may I say?
 5        Heav'n was His home;
 5        But mine the tomb
 5        Wherein He lay.
 
 6  Here might I stay and sing,
 6     No story so divine;
 6  Never was love, dear King,
 6     Never was grief like Thine.
 6        This is my Friend,
 6        In whose sweet praise
 6        I all my days
 6        Could gladly spend.

 1  'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow
 1     The star is dimmed that lately shone;
 1  'Tis midnight in the garden now,
 1     The suff'ring Savior prays alone.
 
 2  'Tis midnight, and from all removed,
 2     The Savior wrestles lone with fears -
 2  E'en that disciple whom He loved
 2     Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.
 
 3  'Tis midnight, and for other's guilt
 3     The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;
 3  Yet He that hath in anguish knelt
 3     Is not forsaken by His God.
 
 4  'Tis midnight, and from ether-plains
 4     Is borne the song that angels know -
 4  Unheard by mortals are the strains
 4     That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.

 1  The Maker of the universe
 1  As Man, for man was made a curse.
 1  The claims of law which He had made,
 1  Unto the uttermost He paid.
 
 2  His holy fingers made the bough
 2  Which grew the thorns that, crowned His brow.
 2  The nails that pierced His hands were mined
 2  In secret places He designed.
 
 3  He made the forest whence there sprung
 3  The tree on which His body hung.
 3  He died upon a cross of wood,
 3  Yet made the hill on which it stood.
 
 4  The sky that darkened o'er His head
 4  By Him above the earth was spread.
 4  The sun that hid from Him its face
 4  By His decree was poised in space.
 
 5  The spear which spilled His precious blood
 5  Was tempered in the fires of God.
 5  The grave in which His form was laid,
 5  Was hewn in rocks His hands had made.
 
 6  The throne on which He now appears
 6  Was His from everlasting years,
 6  But a new glory crowns His brow,
 6  And every knee to Him shall bow.

 1  When we survey the wondrous cross
 1  On which the Lord of glory died,
 1  Our richest gain we count but loss,
 1  And pour contempt on all our pride.
 
 2  Our God forbid that we should boast,
 2  Save in the death of Christ, our Lord;
 2  All the vain things that charm us most,
 2  We'd sacrifice them to His blood.
 
 3  There from His head, His hands, His feet,
 3  Sorrow and love flowed mingled down;
 3  Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
 3  Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
 
 4  His dying crimson, from His head
 4  Spreads o'er His body on the tree;
 4  To all the world then am I dead,
 4  And all the world is dead to me.
 
 5  Were the whole realm of nature ours,
 5  That were an offering far too small;
 5  Love that transcends our highest pow'rs,
 5  Demands our heart, our life, our all.

 4  The measure and the pledge of love,

 1  Behold! Behold the Lamb of God,
 1     On the cross! On the cross!
 1  For us He shed His precious blood,
 1     On the cross! On the cross!
 1  O hear His all-important cry,
 1  "Eli, lama sabachthani?"
 1  Draw near and see the Savior die,
 1     On the cross! On the cross!
 
 2  Behold His arms extended wide,
 2     On the cross! On the cross!
 2  Behold His bleeding hands and side,
 2     On the cross! On the cross!
 2  The sun withholds its rays of light,
 2  The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night,
 2  While Jesus wins the glorious fight,
 2     On the cross! On the cross!
 
 3  By faith we see Him lifted up,
 3     On the cross! On the cross!
 3  He drinks for us the bitter cup,
 3     On the cross! On the cross!
 3  The rocks do rend, the mountains quake,
 3  While Jesus all our sins doth take,
 3  While Jesus suffers for our sake,
 3     On the cross! On the cross!
 
 4  And now the mighty deed is done,
 4     On the cross! On the cross!
 4  The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
 4     On the cross! On the cross!
 4  To heav'n He turns triumphant eyes;
 4  " 'Tis finished" now, the Conqu'ror cries,
 4  Then bows His sacred head and dies,
 4     On the cross! On the cross!
 
 5  But now He's ris'n, ascended, crowned,
 5     On the throne! On the throne!
 5  Heav'n's highest place for Him is found,
 5     On the throne! On the throne!
 5  Our hearts we low in worship bow,
 5  And join, as one, to hail Him now:
 5  "Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou!"
 5     On the throne! On the throne!

 1  Alas! And did my Savior bleed?
 1     And did my Sov'reign die,
 1  Would He devote that sacred head
 1     For such a worm as I?
 
 2  Was it for sins that I had done
 2     He groaned upon the tree?
 2  Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
 2     And love beyond degree!
 
 3  Well might the sun in darkness hide,
 3     And shut his glories in,
 3  When the incarnate Maker died
 3     For man, His creature's sin.
 
 4  Thus might I hide my blushing face
 4     While His dear cross appears
 4  Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
 4     And melt mine eyes to tears.
 
 5  But drops of grief can ne'er repay
 5     The debt of love I owe;
 5  Here, Lord, I give myself away:
 5     'Tis all that I can do.

 1  Himself He could not save,
 1     He on the cross must die,
 1  Or mercy could not come
 1     To ruined sinners nigh;
 1  Yes Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,
 1  That sinners might from sin be freed.
 
 2  Himself He could not save,
 2     For justice must be done;
 2  Our sins' full weight must fall
 2     Upon the sinless One;
 2  For nothing less can God accept
 2  In payment of that fearful debt.
 
 3  Himself He could not save,
 3     For He the Surety stood
 3  For all who now rely
 3     Upon His precious blood;
 3  He bore the penalty of guilt
 3  When on the cross His blood was spilt.
 
 4  Himself He could not save,
 4     What wondrous love is this!
 4  In love Himself He gave,
 4     There ne'er was love like His!
 4  Such love should melt a heart of stone,
 4  Till praise flows forth to Him alone!

 1  No blood, no altar now,
 1     The sacrifice is o'er!
 1  No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
 1     The lamb is slain no more,
 1  But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
 1  To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.
 
 2  We thank Thee for the blood,
 2     The blood of Christ, God's Son:
 2  The blood by which our peace is made,
 2     Redemption great is won,
 2  Delivering us from hell, and sin, and woe;
 2  That His eternal life God may to us bestow.

 1  Not all the blood of beasts,

 2  But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
 2     Takes all our sins away;
 2  A sacrifice of nobler name,
 2     And richer blood than they.
 
 3  My faith would lay her hand
 3     On that dear head of Thine,
 3  While like a penitent I stand,
 3     And there confess my sin.
 
 4  My soul looks back to see
 4     The burdens Thou didst bear
 4  When hanging on the cursed tree,

 5     To see the curse remove;
 5  We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
 5     And sing His bleeding love.

 1  O solemn hour! O hour alone,
 1     In solitary night,
 1  When God the Father's only Son,
 1  As Man, for sinners lost, undone,
 1     Expires - amazing sight!
 1  The Lord of glory crucified!
 1  The Lord of Life has bled and died!
 
 2  O mystery of mysteries!
 2     Of life and death the tree!
 2  Center of two eternities,
 2  Which look with rapt, adoring eyes,
 2     Onward, and back to Thee!
 2  O cross of Christ, where all His pain
 2  And death is our eternal gain.
 
 3  O how our inmost hearts do move,
 3     While gazing on that cross!
 3  The death of the incarnate Love!
 3  What shame, what grief, what joy we prove,
 3     That He should die for us!
 3  Our hearts were broken by that cry,
 3  "Eli, lama sabachthani!"
 
 4  Worthy of death, O Lord, we were;
 4     That vengeance was our due;
 4  In grace Thou, spotless Lamb, didst bear
 4  Thyself our sins, and guilt, and fear;
 4     Justice our Surety slew.
 4  With Thee, our Surety, we have died;
 4  With Thee, we there were crucified.
 
 5  Quickened with Thee with life divine,
 5     Raised with Thee from the dead;
 5  Thine Own, now human and divine,
 5  Shall with Thee in Thy glories shine,
 5     The Church's living Head!
 5  We, who were worthy but to die,
 5  Now with Thee, "Abba Father," cry.

 1  How sweet is the story of Christ's boundless love,
 1  That brought Him to suffer from glory above!
 1  He died in our stead upon Calvary's tree,
 1  Obtaining redemption that we might be free.
 
Sound His praise! Sound His praise!

Praise His name! Praise His name!
   Jesus, God's blessed Son.
We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
Our song is of Jesus and never will end.
 
 2  How wondrous the story! the law's holy claims
 2  Were met by the blood which redemption proclaims.
 2  The judgment of sin has been borne by the Son,
 2  Who glorified God in the work He has done.
 
Sound His praise! Sound His praise!
   All the work has been done;
Praise His name! Praise His name!
   Jesus, God's blessed Son.
We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
Our song is of Jesus and never will end.
 
 3  How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned
 3  How rightly His name above others is owned!
 3  Yes, Jesus, the Savior, the glory-crowned Lord,
 3  Is worthy by all to be ever adored.
 
Sound His praise! Sound His praise!
   All the work has been done;
Praise His name! Praise His name!
   Jesus, God's blessed Son.
We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
Our song is of Jesus and never will end.

 1  How pleasant is the sound of praise!

 1  The stones might tell our shame abroad.

 5  And worship Him as God alone,
 5  We can with exultation sing,
 5  "He wears our nature on the throne."
 
 6  Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,
 6  Which brought Thee here to bleed and die
 6  That Thou lost sinners may restore
 6  And to the Father bring them nigh.

 1  Hail, Thou once despised Jesus!
 1     Hail, Thou still rejected King!
 1  Thou didst suffer to release us,
 1     Thou didst free salvation bring;
 1  Through Thy death and resurrection,
 1     Bearer of our sin and shame!
 1  We enjoy divine protection,
 1     Life and glory through Thy name.
 
 2  Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
 2     All our sins on Thee were laid;
 2  By our Father's love anointed,
 2     Thou redemption's price hast paid.
 2  All who trust Thee are forgiven
 2     Through the virtue of Thy blood;
 2  Opened are the things of heaven,
 2     Grace shines forth to man from God.

 1  Glory be to Jesus,
 1     Who in bitter pains
 1  Poured for me the life-blood
 1     From His sacred veins.
 
 2  Grace and life eternal
 2     In that Blood I find;
 2  Blest be His compassion,
 2     Infinitely kind.
 
 3  Blest through endless ages
 3     Be the precious stream,
 3  Which from endless torments
 3     Did the world redeem.
 
 4  Abel's blood for vengeance
 4     Pleaded to the skies;
 4  But the blood of Jesus
 4     For our pardon cries.
 
 5  It the conscience sprinkles,
 5     Frees our guilty hearts;
 5  Satan in confusion
 5     Terror-struck departs.
 
 6  Oft as earth exulting
 6     Wafts its praise on high,
 6  Angel-hosts rejoicing
 6     Make their glad reply.
 
 7  Lift ye then your voices;
 7     Swell the mighty flood;
 7  Louder still and louder
 7     Praise the precious blood.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  How wonderful redemption is,
 1     My gracious Lord, in Thee!
 1  Not seen, nor heard, nor e'er conceived
 1     What Thou hast done for me!
 1  Thou art divine, mysterious,
 1     Beyond my grandest phrase!
 1  Redemption is so marvellous,
 1     Beyond all pow'r to praise!
 
 2  For us Thou on the Cross wast pierced,
 2     And blood and water streamed;
 2  That life divine be giv'n to us,
 2     That we may be redeemed.
 2  Thy precious blood has made us clean,
 2     That we accepted be;
 2  Regenerated by Thy life,
 2     We now are one with Thee.
 
 3  Thou art the grain divine that died
 3     The many grains to bear,
 3  Which, blent and formed, Thy Body are,
 3     And all Thy nature share.
 3  We are the increase of Thyself,
 3     And Thou our content art;
 3  Through us Thou livest and dost move
 3     And manifested art.
 
 4  Since we're Thy Body, Thou may come
 4     And settle down in us;
 4  In us Thou may obtain Thy home
 4     And we become Thy trust.
 4  Thy heart to satisfy and please,
 4     We are Thy counterpart,
 4  Now in one Body with Thyself,
 4     Enjoying all Thou art.
 
 5  While in remembrance now we meet
 5     And here the symbols see,
 5  For Thy redemption great and full
 5     We're filled with praise to Thee.
 5  Since we are made Thy Body, Lord,
 5     Thy dwelling place and bride,
 5  We would give thanks and worship Thee
 5     And in Thy praise abide.

 1  The Lord is ris'n; and death's dark judgment flood

 1  The Lord is ris'n: we stand beyond the doom
 1  Of all our sin, through Jesus' empty tomb.
 
 2  The Lord is ris'n: with Him we also rose,
 2  And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.
 2  The Lord is ris'n: beyond the judgment land,

 3  The Lord is ris'n: and now redeemed to God,

 1  He who had death's dread pow'r

 1  Far above all is our Savior enthroned;
 1  Crown'd is the Lamb who by sinners is owned,
 1  Living forever to list to our call,
 1  God hath exalted Him far above all.
 
Far above all! Far above all!
Jesus the crucified far above all!
High as His members upon Him we call,
God hath exalted Him far above all!
 
 2  When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves,
 2  Seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;
 2  Looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,
 2  Tread we the billows as safe as on land.
 
Far above all! Far above all!
Jesus the crucified far above all!
High as His members upon Him we call,
God hath exalted Him far above all!
 
 3  High are the cities that dare our assault,
 3  Strong are the barriers that call us to halt;
 3  March we on fearless, and down they must fall,
 3  Vanquish'd by faith in Him far above all.
 
Far above all! Far above all!
Jesus the crucified far above all!
High as His members upon Him we call,
God hath exalted Him far above all!
 
 4  His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,
 4  Far above all while the ages shall roll,
 4  With Him the victors, who follow'd His call,
 4  Share in His royalty far above all.
 
Far above all! Far above all!
Jesus the crucified far above all!
High as His members upon Him we call,
God hath exalted Him far above all!

 1  Behold the Lamb with glory crowned,
 1     To Him all pow'r is giv'n:
 1  No place too high for Him is found,
 1     No place too high in heav'n.
 
 2  He fills the throne - the throne above;
 2     Its rights to Him belong;
 2  The object of His Father's love,
 2     Theme of the ransomed's song.
 
 3  Though high yet He accepts the praise
 3     His people offer here;
 3  The faintest, feeblest note they raise
 3     Will reach the Savior's ear.
 
 4  This song be ours, we join in one
 4     To celebrate the Name
 4  Of Him that sits upon the throne,
 4     And to exalt the Lamb.
 
 5  To Him whom men despise and slight,
 5     To Him be glory giv'n;
 5  The crown is His, and His by right
 5     The highest place in heav'n.

 1  See the Conqu'ror mount in triumph,
 1     See the King in royal state
 1  Riding on the clouds His chariot
 1     To His;heav'nly palace gate;
 1  Hark! The choirs of angel voices
 1     Joyful hallelujahs sing,
 1  And the portals high are lifted
 1     To receive, to receive, to receive their
 1  heav'nly King.
 
 2  Who is this that comes in glory,
 2     With the trump of jubilee?
 2  Lord of battles, God of armies,
 2     He has gained the victory;
 2  He who on the cross did suffer,
 2     He who from the grave arose,
 2  He has vanquished sin and Satan,
 2     He by death, He by death, He by
 2  death has spoiled His foes.
 
 3  While He lifts His hands in blessing
 3     He is parted from His friends;
 3  While their eager eyes behold Him,
 3     He upon the clouds ascends;
 3  He who walked with God and pleased Him,
 3     Preaching truth and doom to come,
 3  He, our Enoch, is translated
 3     To His home, to His home, to His everlasting
 3  home.
 
 4  Now our heavenly Aaron enters,
 4     With His blood, within the veil;
 4  Joshua now is come to Canaan,
 4     And the kings before Him quail;
 4  Now He plants the tribes of Israel
 4     In their promised resting-place;
 4  Now our great Elijah offers
 4     Of His grace, of His grace,
 4  double portion of His grace.
 
 5  He has raised our human nature
 5     On the clouds to God's right hand;
 5  There we sit in heav'nly places,
 5     There with Him in glory stand. Jesus reigns,
 5  adored by angels;
 5     Man with God is on the throne;
 5  Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension
 5     We by faith, we by faith, we by
 5  faith behold our own.

 1  Lo! In heaven Jesus sitting,
 1     Christ the Lord is there enthroned;
 1  As the man by God exalted,
 1     With God's glory He is crowned.
 
 2  He hath put on human nature,
 2     Died according to God's plan,
 2  Resurrected with a body,
 2     And ascended as a man.
 
 3  God in Him on earth was humbled,
 3     God with man was domiciled;
 3  Man in Him in heav'n exalted,
 3     Man with God is reconciled.
 
 4  He as God with man is mingled,
 4     God in man is testified;
 4  He as man with God is blended,
 4     Man in God is glorified.
 
 5  From the Glorified in heaven
 5     The inclusive Spirit came;
 5  All of Jesus' work and Person
 5     Doth this Spirit here proclaim.
 
 6  With the Glorified in heaven
 6     Is the Church identified;
 6  By the Spirit of this Jesus
 6     Are His members edified.
 
 7  Lo! A man is now in heaven
 7     As the Lord of all enthroned;
 7  This is Jesus Christ our Savior,
 7     With God's glory ever crowned!

 4     Pour thy whisp'ring praise along.

 5     Turn my eye from all beside,
 5  Let me but Thy beauty see,
 5     Other light is dark to me.

 1  Gazing on the Lord in glory,

 1  There we read the wondrous story
 1     Of the cross - its shame and woe.
 
 2  Every mark of dark dishonor
 2     Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow,
 2  All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow
 2     Told in answ'ring glory now.
 
 3  On that cross, alone, forsaken,
 3     Where no pity'ng eve was found;
 3  Now, to God's right hand exalted,
 3     With Thy praise the heavens resound.
 
 4  Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,
 4     Hide His face from Thy deep need?
 4  In Thy face once marred and smitten,
 4     All His glory now we read.
 
 5  Gazing on it we adore Thee,
 5     Blessed, precious, holy Lord;
 5  Thou, the Lamb, alone art worthy -
 5     This be earth's and heaven's accord.
 
 6  Rise our hearts, and bless the Father,
 6     Ceaseless song e'en here begun,
 6  Endless praise and adoration

 3     No angel in the sky
 3     Can fully bear that sight,
 3  But downward bends his burning eye
 3     At mysteries so bright.
 
 4     Crown Him the Lord of peace,
 4     Whose power a scepter sways
 4  From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
 4     And all be prayer and praise.
 4     His reign shall know no end,
 4     And round His pierced feet
 4  Fair flowers of glory now extend
 4     Their fragrance ever sweet.
 
 5     Crown Him the Lord of years,
 5     The Potentate of time,
 5  Creator of the rolling spheres,
 5     Ineffably sublime.
 5     All hail, Redeemer, hail!
 5     For Thou hast died for me;
 5  Thy praise shall never, never fail
 5     Throughout eternity.

 1  On His Father's throne is seated
 1  Christ the Lord, the living One!
 1  All His toil on earth completed,
 1  All His work for sinners done.
 1  In the glory, in the glory,
 1  See Him - God's eternal Son!
 
 2  Every knee shall bow before Him,
 2  Every tongue confess His name,
 2  Ransomed myriads shall adore Him,
 2  Who endured the sinner's shame!
 2  From the glory, from the glory,
 2  God doth now His worth proclaim.
 
 3  Man, the cross to Him awarded;
 3  Man, the Savior crucified;
 3  This world's judgment stands recorded,
 3  God's own justice satisfied!
 3  By the glory, by the glory,
 3  Christ was claimed on earth who died.
 
 4  Son of Man, His incarnation
 4  Opened first the tale of grace;
 4  Son of Man, in new creation
 4  Leader of a chosen race!
 4  Well may glory, well may glory,
 4  Give to Him the honored place!

 1  O how deep and how far-reaching
 1     Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!
 1  Far beyond my pow'r to fathom,
 1     Deeper than the deepest sea!
 1  It has caused Thee death to suffer
 1     And to me Thyself impart,
 1  That in Thee I might be grafted
 1     And become of Thee a part.
 
 2  Who can tell of all the wonders
 2     Which Thy love for me has wrought,
 2  Yet the greatest of these wonders
 2     Is that Thou to me art brought.
 2  Oh! To me Thy love has given
 2     All Thou art as my supply;
 2  As true life I now may share Thee
 2     And Thy riches e'er enjoy.
 
 3  Lord, Thy love is the expression
 3     Of Thy loving self divine,
 3  Making life so full of meaning,
 3     Harmonized with God's design.
 3  Grace of life, how all-sufficient,
 3     Is my portion day by day;
 3  I'm the object of Thy favor
 3     And Thy sweetness taste alway.
 
 4  What from Thee can separate me?
 4     Thou wilt love me to the end!
 4  Oh! Thy love is so prevailing,
 4     E'en Thyself with me to blend!
 4  We two one will be for ever;
 4     I am Thine and Thou art mine!
 4  This will be my testimony:
 4     In Thy love we'll ever twine!

 1  O blessed Savior, is Thy love
 1     So great! So full! So free!
 1  Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,
 1     Our lives, engaged with Thee.
 
 2  We love Thee for the glorious worth
 2     Which in Thyself we see;
 2  We love Thee for that shameful cross,
 2     Endured so patiently.
 
 3  No man of greater love can boast
 3     Than for his friend to die;
 3  Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
 3     What love with Thine can vie?
 
 4  Though in the very form of God,
 4     With heav'nly glory crowned,
 4  Thou didst a servant's form assume,
 4     Beset with sorrow round.
 
 5  Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
 5     In everything but sin,
 5  That we as like Thee might become
 5     As we unlike had been:
 
 6  Like Thee in strength, in meekness, love,
 6     In life in ev'ry phase;
 6  From glory into glory changed,
 6     Till we behold Thy face.
 
 7  O Lord, we treasure in our hearts
 7     The mem'ry of Thy love;
 7  And ever shall Thy name to us
 7     A grateful odor prove.

 1  It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
 1  My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine
 1  Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
 1  Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
 1              Know more and more.
 
 2  It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
 2  My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine
 2  Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,
 2  A love which can remove all guilty fear,
 2              And love beget.
 
 3  It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
 3  My Savior Jesus; yet this heart of mine
 3  Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
 3  Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
 3              Nigh unto God.
 
 4  But though I cannot sing, or tell, to know
 4  The fullness of Thy love, while here below,
 4  My empty vessel I may freely bring;
 4  O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
 4              My vessel fill.
 
 5  I am an empty vessel - not one thought
 5  Or look of love to Thee I've ever brought;
 5  Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
 5  With this the empty sinner's only plea,
 5              Thou lovest me.
 
 6  Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!
 6  Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
 6  Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
 6  And never to another fountain fly,
 6              But unto Thee.
 
 7  Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,
 7  When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,
 7  Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
 7  Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
 7              My soul shall sing.

 1  Christ delivered me when bound,
 1  And when bleeding, healed my wound;
 1  Sought me wand'ring, set me right,
 1  Turned my darkness into light.
 
 2  Can a woman's tender care

 2  Yes, she may forgetful be;
 2  Yet will He remember me.
 
 3  His is an unchanging love,

 5  Oh, for grace to love Thee more.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  I have a Friend, whose faithful love
 1  Is more than all the world to me:
 1  'Tis higher than the heights above,
 1  And deeper than the soundless sea;
 1           So old, so new,
 1           So strong, so true;
 1  Before the earth received its frame,
 1  He loved me - Blessed be His name!
 
 2  He held the highest place above,
 2  Adored by all the sons of flame,
 2  Yet such His self-denying love,
 2  He laid aside His crown and came
 2           To seek the lost,
 2           And at the cost
 2  Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
 2  He sought me - Blessed be His name!
 
 3  It was a lonely path He trod,
 3  From every human soul apart;
 3  Known only to Himself and God
 3  Was all the grief that filled His heart,
 3           Yet from the track
 3           He turned not back,
 3  Till where I lay in want and shame,
 3  He found me - Blessed be His name!
 
 4  Then dawned at last that day of dread,
 4  When desolate, yet undismayed,
 4  With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
 4  He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
 4           Was then made sin
 4           On Calvary,
 4  And, dying there in grief and shame,
 4  He saved me - Blessed be His name!
 
 5  Long as I live my song shall tell
 5  The wonders of His dying love;
 5  And when at last I go to dwell
 5  With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
 5           My joy shall be
 5           His face to see,
 5  And bowing there with loud acclaim
 5  I'll praise Him-Blessed be His name!

 1  Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?
 1     O height, O depth of love!
 1  Thou one with us on Calvary,
 1     We one with Thee above.
 
 2  Such was Thy grace that for our sake
 2     Thou didst from heaven come down,
 2  With us of flesh and blood partake,
 2     In all our misery one.
 
 3  Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine
 3     Confessed and borne by Thee;
 3  The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,
 3     To set Thy members free.
 
 4  Ascended now, in glory bright,
 4     Head of the Church Thou art;
 4  Nor life nor death, nor depth nor height,
 4     Thy saints and Thee can part.
 
 5  Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own
 5     This wondrous mystery,
 5  That Thou in heaven with us art one,
 5     And we are one with Thee.
 
 6  Soon, soon shall come that glorious day
 6     When, seated on Thy throne,
 6  Thou shalt to wondering worlds display
 6     That Thou with us art one.

 1  Lord, Thy love has sought and found us
 1     Wand'ring in this desert wide;
 1  Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us,
 1     For us suffered, bled, and died.
 1  Sing, my soul! He loved thee,
 1  Jesus gave Himself for me.
 
 2  Hark! What sounds of bitter weeping
 2     From yon lonesome garden sweep;
 2  'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,
 2     While His followers sink in sleep.
 2  Ah, my soul, He loved thee,
 2  Yes, He gave Himself for me.
 
 3  He is speaking to His Father,
 3     Tasting deep that bitter cup,
 3  Yet He takes it, willing rather
 3     For our sakes to drink it up.
 3  Oh, what love! He loved me!
 3  Gave Himself, my soul, for thee.
 
 4  Then that closing scene of anguish:
 4     All God's waves and billows roll
 4  Over Him, there left to languish
 4     On the cross, to save my soul.
 4  Matchless love! How vast, how free,
 4  Jesus gave Himself for me.
 
 5  Hark again! His cries are waking
 5     Echoes on dark Calvary's hill;
 5  God, my God, art Thou forsaking
 5     Him who always did Thy will?
 5  Ah, my soul! It was for thee,
 5  Yes! He gave Himself for me.
 
 6  Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,
 6     Glad Thy suff'ring time is o'er;
 6  To Thy Father's throne ascended,
 6     There Thou liv'st, to die no more.
 6  Yes, my soul, He lives for thee,
 6  He who gave Himself for me.
 
 7  Lord, we worship and adore Thee
 7     For Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;
 7  Perfect soon in joy before Thee,
 7     We shall see Thee face to face.
 7  Yet e'en now our song shall be,
 7  Jesus gave Himself for me.

 1  Give me a sight, O Savior,
 1  Of Thy wondrous love to me,

Oh, make me understand it,
Help me to take it in,

 2  Was it the nails, O Savior,
 2  That bound Thee to the tree?

 1  King of my life, I crown Thee now,
 1     Thine shall the glory be;
 1  Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,
 1     Lead me to Calvary.
 
Lest I forget Gethsemane;
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
   Lead me to Calvary.
 
 2  Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,

 2  Angels in robes of light arrayed
 2     Guarded Thee while Thou slept.
 
Lest I forget Gethsemane;
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
   Lead me to Calvary.
 
 3  Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
 3     Come with a gift to Thee;
 3  Show to me now the empty tomb,

Lest I forget Gethsemane;
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
   Lead me to Calvary.
 
 4  May I be willing, Lord, to bear
 4     Daily my cross for Thee;
 4  Even Thy cup of grief to share,
 4     Thou hast borne all for me.
 
Lest I forget Gethsemane;
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
   Lead me to Calvary.
 
 5  Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
 5     For all that know not Thee;
 5  Then touch my lips with holy fire,
 5     To speak of Calvary.
 
Lest I forget Gethsemane;
Lest I forget Thine agony;
Lest I forget Thy love for me,
   Lead me to Calvary.

 2  Jesus is the name that charms us;

 1  Lord, Thou art the lovely Bridegroom,

 1  Thy dear self is so, attractive,
 1     To our heart so beauteous!
 
 2  Dear Beloved, we admire Thee,
 2     Who can tell Thy preciousness;
 2  All Thy love we deeply treasure
 2     And Thine untold loveliness.
 
 3  Thou art fairer than the fairest,
 3     Thou art sweeter than the sweet;
 3  Thou art meek and Thou art gracious,
 3     None can e'er with Thee compete.
 
 4  Full of myrrh are all Thy garments,
 4     And Thy lips are filled with grace;
 4  In the savor of Thy suffering,
 4     We in love Thyself embrace.
 
 5  It is with the oil of gladness
 5     Thy God hath anointed Thee;
 5  From the palaces of ivory
 5     Praise shall ever rise to Thee.
 
 6  God hath blessed Thee, Lord, forever,
 6     Thou hast won the victory;
 6  Now we see Thee throned in glory
 6     With Thy pow'r and majesty.
 
 7  Thou art the desire of nations,
 7     All Thy worth they'll ever prove;
 7  Thou, the chiefest of ten thousand,
 7     Ever worthy of our love.

 1  Lord Jesus Christ, our heart feels sweet
 1     Whene'er we think on Thee,
 1  And long that to Thy presence dear
 1     We soon might raptured be!
 
Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
   In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
   Admires and loves our heart!
 
 2  There is no music adequate
 2     Thy grace in full to praise,
 2  Nor there a heart which could enjoy
 2     Thy love in every phase.
 
Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
   In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
   Admires and loves our heart!
 
 3  Yet, what delights our heart the most
 3     Is not Thy love, Thy grace;
 3  But it is Thine own loving Self
 3     That satisfies always.
 
Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
   In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
   Admires and loves our heart!
 
 4  Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair,
 4     And sweeter than the sweet;
 4  Beside Thee, none in heaven or earth
 4     Our heart's desire could meet.
 
Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
   In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
   Admires and loves our heart!

 1  Glory be to Him who loved us,

 2  Glory, worship, laud and blessing,
 2  Thus the choir triumphant sings;

 2  Lord of lords, and King of kings.

 3  Glory ever and forever
 3  To the King of Glory bring.

 1  O Lord, how rich Thou art to us,
 1     Thy love reveals the measure!
 1  The boundless riches of Thyself,
 1     In spirit here we treasure.

 2  Incarnate in the flesh with us,
 2     And God to us defining.
 
 3  Thou art the tabernacle true,

 3  For God Thou art the temple too,

 6     For God and us appointed.
 
 7  Thou art the Savior crucified,
 7     Whence issued blood and water,
 7  That we might be redeemed to God,

 8  The all-inclusive Spirit comes
 8     To us with all Thy merit.

 10  Thou art the very life divine,
 10     Which all our spirits quickens;
 10  The life which brings us out of death
 10     And all our being strengthens.
 
 11  Lord, Thou art God's reality,
 11     The truth that meets God's pleasure;
 11  The truth that brings Thyself to us,
 11     That we may know Thy measure.
 
 12  Thou also art the way of life,
 12     Which unto glory leads us;
 12  The way of Thy reality,
 12     Which into vict'ry speeds us.
 
 13  Thou art the resurrection too,
 13     All death Thy life doth swallow;
 13  'Tis by Thy resurrection pow'r,
 13     We bear the cross and follow.
 
 14  Thou art the spotless Lamb of God,
 14     Who died for our redemption;
 14  Thou art the Spirit-giver too,
 14     For our regeneration.
 
 15  Thou art the serpent made of brass,
 15     Who saveth us from evil;
 15  Thou on the tree wast lifted up,
 15     To crush for us the devil.
 
 16  Thou art the Shepherd and the door,
 16     For us to leave the sheepfold,
 16  By Thee we have full liberty
 16     And share the pasture freehold.
 
 17  Thy washing keeps us always clean,
 17     In function like the laver;
 17  Thus we are kept in fellowship,
 17     Partaking of Thy favor.
 
 18  Thou art the heav'nly riven rock,
 18     With living water flowing;
 18  We drink of this refreshing stream,
 18     Thy quenching power knowing.
 
 19  Thou art the heav'nly well, in Thee
 19     Is living water ever;
 19  We drink of Thine eternal life,
 19     And thirst no more forever.

 21     Thyself we breathe in spirit,
 21  By Thee we live, in Thee we walk,
 21     Thy riches we inherit.
 
 22  Thou art the grain of wheat divine,
 22     That died and rose with glory,
 22  To bring forth us as many grains
 22     To form Thy glorious Body.

 23     And we in Thee are branches;
 23  In Thee abiding, Thou in us,
 23     We share in all Thy riches.
 
 24  Thou art the Bridegroom from above
 24     To take the Bride, Thy Body;
 24  That we may be with Thee as one,
 24     In life and love and glory.
 
 25  Thou art the ladder Jacob saw,
 25     By Thee the heav'n is open;
 25  In Thee we are the house of God,
 25     And earth is joined to heaven.
 
 26  O Lord, Thou art the great "I AM,"
 26     Who all our need doth furnish;
 26  Enjoying Thee as all in all,
 26     God's purpose we accomplish.

 1  Dear Lord, Thou art the Son of God,
 1     His absolute expression;
 1  In Thee God speaks to us today,
 1     Thou art His definition.
 
 2  The impress of God's substance true,
 2     Effulgence of His glory,
 2  Thou even art our God Himself,
 2     In Thee is His full story.
 
 3  By Thee was made, the universe,
 3     Subsisting by Thy merit;
 3  The heir God hath appointed Thee,
 3     That all Thou may inherit.
 
 4  Since Thou hast purged our sins by death,
 4     In heaven Thou art seated,
 4  Till all Thy foes will be subdued
 4     And all God's will completed.
 
 5  A better name than angels have,
 5     From God Thou didst inherit;
 5  As Son of God to us as life,
 5     Thou now art in the Spirit.
 
 6  Thy kingdom is of righteousness,
 6     Thy throne will stand forever;
 6  God hath in love anointed Thee,
 6     And Thou shalt wax old never.
 
 7  Thou also art a man indeed,
 7     With all our human nature;
 7  By grace Thou tastedst death for us
 7     That we may have Thy stature.
 
 8  With glory and with honor crowned,
 8     All things to Thee are subject,
 8  As Captain of salvation, full,
 8     Thou art thru sufferings perfect.
 
 9  By death the devil Thou hast spoiled,
 9     And from death's bondage freed us;
 9  Thou sanctifiest us in life
 9     And dost to glory speed us.
 
 10  To us, Thy brethren, Thou art here,
 10     The Father's Name declaring;
 10  Within the Church Thou singest hymns,
 10     God's praises with us sharing.
 
 11  Superior Thou to Moses, Lord,
 11     As to the house the builder;
 11  Thou, our Apostle sent from God,
 11     Art worthy of more splendor.
 
 12  Thou art our real Joshua,
 12     By Thee the rest we enter;
 12  Our full salvation is of Thee,
 12     Our faith on Thee doth center.
 
 13  Thou art the heav'nly rest -to us,
 13     Now dwelling in our spirit,
 13  For us to enter as the land
 13     And all Thy good inherit.
 
 14  Superior Thou to Aaron too -
 14     Thyself, the offering given,
 14  Thou enteredst, as our Great High Priest,
 14     The holiest place in heaven.
 
 15  Thou art our true Melchisedec,
 15     With endless life in power,
 15  To minister the "bread and wine,"
 15     In every needful hour.
 
 16  Thou art the better sacrifice,
 16     Thru the eternal Spirit,
 16  Once offered unto God for us,
 16     That we may gain Thy merit.
 
 17  A better covenant was made
 17     With Thy dear blood in heaven;
 17  By Thee this sure new testament
 17     To Thy redeemed was given.
 
 18  Thou, art its Maker adequate,
 18     For Thou dost have the merit;
 18  Thou art its Giver competent
 18     That we may all inherit;
 
 19  Its qualified Executor,
 19     By life of resurrection;
 19  Its potent Mediator too,
 19     Fulfilling God's election.
 
 20  Lord, Thou art now within the veil,
 20     As our unique Forerunner,
 20  That by Thy life, without the camp,
 20     We'll in the race be runners.
 
 21  Thou art the Finisher of faith,
 21     As well its Author perfect;
 21  By faith and love we follow Thee,
 21     And e'er to Thee are subject.
 
 22  Unequaled is Thy worth, dear Lord,
 22     And all Thou art we treasure;
 22  Thou art so perfect and complete,
 22     Beyond all human measure.

 1  Thou art the Son beloved,
 1     The image of our God;
 1  Thou art the saints' dear portion,
 1     Imparted thru Thy blood.
 1  Among all God's creation
 1     Thou art the firstborn One;
 1  By Thee all was created,
 1     All for Thyself to own.
 
 2  Thou art before all creatures,
 2     In Thee all things consist;
 2  Of all Thou art the center,
 2     By Thee all things subsist.
 2  Thou art the sole beginning,
 2     The Firstborn from the dead;
 2  And for the Church, Thy Body,
 2     Thou art the glorious Head.
 
 3  Because it pleased the Father,
 3     All fulness dwells in Thee,
 3  That Thou might have the first place
 3     In all we ever see.
 3  All things Thou reconciledst
 3     To God by Thy shed blood,
 3  To thus present us holy
 3     And blameless unto God.
 
 4  In Thee God's fulness dwelleth,
 4     Thou art God's mystery;
 4  The treasures of all wisdom
 4     And knowledge are in Thee.
 4  Thou art the hope of glory,
 4     In us Thou dost abide;
 4  In Thee we are perfected
 4     And God is satisfied.
 
 5  All things are but a shadow
 5     Which unto us reveal
 5  Thyself, in whom we're rooted,
 5     The only One that's real.
 5  Enjoying all Thy riches,
 5     Thy fulness we will be;
 5  We'll hold Thee, as Thy Body,
 5     And grow with God in Thee.
 
 6  With Thee in God we're hidden,
 6     Thou art in us our life;
 6  Thy peace in us presiding,
 6     We rest from all our strife.
 6  In the new man, Thy Body,
 6     Thou art all in all;
 6  Our all-inclusive Savior,
 6     Thyself we'll ever call.

 1  Lord, Thou art the "Seed of woman,"
 1     Born to bruise the enemy;
 1  Thou didst take the human nature,
 1     Die to win the victory.
 1  As the very God incarnate,
 1     Flesh and blood Thou didst partake;
 1  Thou thru death hast crushed the devil
 1     And his pow'r of death didst break.
 
 2  "Seed of Abraham," Thou art, Lord,
 2     By God's promise Thou hast come,
 2  That the blessing He hath promised
 2     On all people thus might come.
 2  Abraham Thou hast preceded,
 2     For Thou art the great "I AM,"

 3  Truly Thou art "David's offspring,"
 3     Yet "my Lord" he calleth Thee,
 3  For Thou art his "root" and fountain,
 3     "Lord of all" eternally.
 
 4  Though "a child" born with our nature,
 4     Thou the "Mighty God" art called;
 4  Thou, "a son." to us art given,
 4     "Everlasting Father" called.
 4  All the blessings God hath promised,
 4     With our faith on Thee depend;
 4  Thou art "Yea" and "Amen" for them,
 4     All the content and the end!

 1  Dear Lord, Thou art so much to us

 3     As life both rich and real.
 
 4  Thou art the Priest from us to God,
 4     The holy Priest for us,
 4  Like Aaron called of God from men,
 4     For us Thou servest thus.
 4  In love Thou bearest us to God,
 4     The great High Priest to serve;
 4  With love Thou intercedest there
 4     And dost with strength preserve.
 
 5  Thou art the Priest from God to us,
 5     The royal Priest of God;
 5  Like Salem's King, Melchisedec,
 5     The minister of God.
 5  With bread and wine Thou cam'st from God
 5     To us in time of need;
 5  Thou cam'st with God that we in Him
 5     Might fully share indeed.
 
 6  Thou art the King as David was,
 6     And God's desire dost seek;
 6  The battle fought, the foe subdued,
 6     God's heart Thou dost bespeak.
 6  Thou art empowered on the throne,
 6     Not with a human rod,
 6  But with authority divine
 6     To reign for us and God.
 
 7  Thou art the King like Solomon,
 7     Whose rule with peace was filled;
 7  With wisdom Thou dost reign in pow'r
 7     And Thou God's house dost build.
 7  As King unseen Thou reignest now
 7     Among Thy saints with love;
 7  One day, when Thou shalt reign with us,
 7     Thou wilt Thy kingship prove.
 
 8  As King and Priest and Prophet too,
 8     How precious, Lord, art Thou;
 8  Thy worth to God, Thy worth to us,
 8     We all with love avow.
 8  O how we treasure what Thou art,
 8     Our hearts are drawn by Thee;
 8  To Thee we'll give our thanks and praise
 8     Throughout eternity.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Thou art God's testimony, Lord,
 1     Much better than the law;
 1  The law in letter was engraved,
 1     In it Thy type men saw.
 1  A definition was the law,
 1     God's picture to provide;
 1  But Thou art God's reality,
 1     In Thee doth God abide.
 
 2  The ark of testimony too
 2     Was but a type of Thee;
 2  In it the law of God was placed,
 2     But God in Thee we see.
 2  The ark, in type, was made of wood
 2     And. overlaid with gold;
 2  It typifies Thee as a man,
 2     Who God in full doth hold.
 
 3  Thou art the tabernacle too,
 3     God's holy dwelling place;
 3  Incarnate in the flesh Thou art,
 3     And full of truth and grace.
 3  God's glory we behold in Thee,
 3     Thou art the Word divine;
 3  Thy words and deeds of love and light
 3     Do God in life define.
 
 4  The temple was a type of Thee;
 4     The house of God Thou art;
 4  God dwells in Thee, Himself to show,
 4     His fulness to impart.
 4  Though Thou by Satan wast destroyed
 4     And numbered with the dead,
 4  In resurrection Thou dost build
 4     A larger one instead.
 
 5  The city shows Thy fulness true,
 5     A figure of Thy Bride,
 5  The increase of Thyself in full,
 5     In whom Thou dost abide.
 5  In Thee is God, the light divine,
 5     The lamp in her art Thou;
 5  With Thee God shines thru her on all,
 5     His glory to avow.
 
 6  The tabernacle and the ark,
 6     The law within them stored,
 6  The temple and the city too,
 6     Are all Thyself, dear Lord.
 6  Thou art the hub, Thou art the rim,
 6     The all in all Thou art!
 6  In Thee we see both God and man,
 6     How precious to our heart!

 1  Lord, Thou art all the offerings
 1     Prepared by God for us;
 1  They are so rich in meaning,
 1     So sweet and glorious.
 1  They have fulfilled God's purpose
 1     And met His heart's desire;
 1  They too have satisfied us,
 1     And faced what we require.
 
 2  Thou art the burnt-oblation,
 2     Consumed by holy fire;
 2  To God as a sweet savor,
 2     Fulfilling His desire.
 2  Thou walkedst in God's presence,
 2     And all His will pursued;
 2  Thyself the spotless offering,
 2     For us to God as food.
 
 3  Thou art the meal-oblation,
 3     With "oil" and "frankincense";
 3  'Tis holy, fine, and perfect,
 3     And sweet to every sense.'
 3  Thou art the peace-oblation,
 3     The peace for us to make,
 3  That we with God may share Thee,
 3     As food of Thee partake.
 
 4  Thou art the sin-oblation,
 4     For us Thou sin wast made;
 4  By death for our redemption
 4     The ransom Thou hast paid.
 4  Thou art the trespass-offering,
 4     Thou all our sins didst bear
 4  To satisfy God's justice,
 4     That we His pardon share.
 
 5  Thou art the wave-oblation,
 5     The resurrected One;
 5  O'er Hades, death and darkness,
 5     The vict'ry Thou hast won.
 5  Thou art the heave-oblation,
 5     Thou didst ascend to God;
 5  As such in heav'nly places
 5     Thou art our holy food.

 1  Lord, the ancient types and symbols
 1     As our all Thyself portrayed;
 1  As was shadowed in those figures,
 1     Real to us Thou now art made.
 1  Contemplating such a picture,
 1     As we on its wonders gaze,
 1  How we marvel at Thy riches
 1     And our song of worship raise.
 
 2  Lord, Thou art our true Passover,
 2     God passed over us thru Thee;
 2  By Thyself and Thy redemption
 2     We with God have harmony.
 2  Thou, the Lamb of God, redeemedst us
 2     With Thyself and with Thy blood;
 2  We apply Thy blood, our ransom,
 2     Eating Thee, our real food.
 
 3  Lord, Thou art the Bread from heaven,
 3     The unleavened Bread of life;
 3  Eating Thee, with Thee we mingle,
 3     Ceasing from our sin and strife.
 3  Lamb and Bread are both Thy figures,
 3     Showing Thou art life to us;
 3  Feasting on Thee at Thy table,
 3     We enjoy Thy riches thus.
 
 4  Lord, Thou art the Heav'nly Manna,
 4     As our daily food supply;
 4  Strengthening and energizing,
 4     All our need to satisfy.
 4  Living Rock Thou also art, Lord,
 4     Cleft for us with life to flow;
 4  Drinking of this living water,
 4     Thirst is quenched, Thy life we know.
 
 5  Lord, Thou art the Land of Canaan -
 5     Elevated, rich and good,
 5  Flowing with both milk and honey
 5     In a glorious plenitude.
 5  By Thy surplus God we worship,
 5     In Thy fellowship we move;
 5  Thus in love we're joined together
 5     And God's building we will prove.

 1  O Lord, Thou art the Alpha

 1  Thou art the sole Beginning,

 2     All things will end in Thee;
 2  As God's full Alphabet, Lord,

 4  Thou, the unique Beginning,
 4     Didst all originate;
 4  Thou, as the only Ending,
 4     Wilt all things terminate.
 
 5  O Lord, how we adore Thee
 5     And treasure Thee with love;
 5  As Alpha and Omega,
 5     Thou art all things above.
 5  We praise Thee, the Beginning,
 5     The very First we call;
 5  We worship Thee, the Ending,
 5     The only Last of all.

 1  In the bosom of the Father,
 1     Ere the ages had begun,
 1  Thou wast in the Father's glory,
 1     God's unique begotten Son.
 1  When to us the Father gave Thee,
 1     Thou in person wast the same,
 1  All the fulness of the Father
 1     In the Spirit to proclaim.
 
 2  By Thy death and resurrection,
 2     Thou wast made God's firstborn Son;
 2  By Thy life to us imparting,
 2     Was Thy duplication done.
 2  We, in Thee regenerated,
 2     Many sons to God became;
 2  Truly as Thy many brethren,
 2     We are as Thyself the same.
 
 3  Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord,
 3     Falling to the earth to die,
 3  That thru death and resurrection
 3     Thou in life may multiply.
 3  We were brought forth in Thy nature
 3     And the many grains became;
 3  As one loaf we all are blended,
 3     All Thy fulness to proclaim.
 
 4  We're Thy total reproduction,
 4     Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,
 4  Thine expression and Thy fulness,
 4     For Thee ever to abide.
 4  We are Thy continuation,
 4     Thy life-increase and Thy spread,
 4  Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,
 4     One with Thee, our glorious Head.
 
 5  Lord Thy human shell was broken.
 5     Life and glory Thou released
 5  That thine own incorporation
 5     With thy chosen be increased.
 5  We with Thee incorporated:
 5     Thou in us and we in Thee.
 5  Here we eat the hidden manna,
 5     New Jerusalem to be.

 1  Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus,
 1     Losing sight of all but Thee,
 1  O what joy Thy presence gives us,
 1     Calling up our hearts to Thee!
 
 2  Loved with love which knows no measure,
 2     Save the Father's love to Thee,
 2  Blessed Lord, our hearts would treasure
 2     All the Father's thoughts of Thee.
 
 3  All His joy, His rest, His pleasure -
 3     All His deep delight in Thee -
 3  Lord, Thy heart alone can measure
 3     What Thy Father found in Thee.
 
 4  How He set His love upon Thee -
 4     Called Thee His beloved Son;
 4  Yet for us He did not spare Thee,
 4     By Thy death our life was won.
 
 5  O the joy, the wondrous singing,
 5     When we see Thee as Thou art!
 5  Thy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing
 5     Sweetest music to God's heart.
 
 6  Notes of gladness, songs unceasing,
 6     Hymns of everlasting praise,
 6  Psalms of glory, joy increasing,
 6     Through God's endless day of days.

 1  Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,

 1  From the best bliss that earth imparts,
 1  We turn unfilled to Thee again.
 
 2  Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
 2  Thou savest those that on Thee call;
 2  To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,
 2  To them that find Thee, all in all!
 
 3  We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
 3  And long to feast upon Thee still;
 3  We drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,
 3  And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!
 
 4  Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
 4  Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
 4  Glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
 4  Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.
 
 5  O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay!
 5  Make all our moments calm and bright,
 5  Chase all dark thoughts of sin away,
 5  Shed o'er us here Thy holy light.

 1  O Christ, He is the fountain,

 1  Its living streams I've tasted
 1     Which save from grief and strife.
 1  And to an ocean fullness,
 1     His mercy doth expand;
 1  His grace is all-sufficient
 1     As by His wisdom planned.
 
 2  O I am my Beloved's.

 2  He brings a poor vile sinner

 2  I'm hidden in His presence

 3  The Bride eyes not her garment,
 3     But her dear Bridegroom's face;
 3  I will not gaze at glory.
 3     But on my King of grace:

 3  The Lamb is all the glory,
 3     And my eternal stand!

 2  And though the wilderness we tread,

 5  Till we, in victory displayed,
 5     Thy face in glory see.

 1  O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!
 1     Forgive me if I say,
 1  For very love, Thy sacred name
 1     A thousand times a day.
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!
 
 2  I love Thee so I know not how
 2     My transports to control;
 2  Thy love is like a burning fire
 2     Within my very soul.
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!
 
 3  For Thou to me art all in all;
 3     My honor and my wealth;
 3  My heart's desire, my body's strength,
 3     My soul's eternal health.
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!
 
 4  Burn, burn, O love, within my heart,
 4     Burn fiercely night and day,
 4  Till all the dross of earthly loves
 4     Is burned, and burned away.
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!
 
 5  O light in darkness, joy in grief,
 5     O heaven's life on earth;
 5  Jesus, my love, my treasure, who
 5     Can tell what Thou art worth?
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!
 
 6  What limit is there to this love?
 6     Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?
 6  On, on! Our Lord is sweeter far
 6     Today than yesterday.
 
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
   I love, I love Thee, Lord!

 7  Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,
 7     And through eternity.

 1  I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me,
 1     He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
 1  The Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see
 1     All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
 1  In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,
 1     He tells me every care on Him to roll:
 1  He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
 1     He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
 
 2  He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;
 2     In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;
 2  I've all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn
 2     From my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.
 2  Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,
 2     Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:
 2  He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
 2     He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
 
 3  He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
 3     While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
 3  A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
 3     With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
 3  Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,
 3     Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
 3  He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
 3     He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

 1  On that same night, Lord Jesus,
 1     When all around Thee joined
 1  To cast its darkest shadow
 1     Across Thy holy mind,
 1  We hear Thy voice, blest Savior,
 1     "This do, remember me",
 1  With grateful hearts responding,
 1     We do remember Thee.
 
 2  The depth of all Thy suffering
 2     No heart could e'er conceive,
 2  The cup of wrath o'erflowing
 2     For us Thou didst receive;
 2  And, oh, of God forsaken
 2     On the accursed tree;
 2  With grateful hearts, Lord Jesus,
 2     We now remember Thee.
 
 3  We think of all the darkness
 3     Which round Thy spirit pressed,
 3  Of all those waves and billows,
 3     Which rolled across Thy breast.
 3  Oh, there Thy grace unbounded
 3     And perfect love we see;
 3  With joy and sorrow mingling,
 3     We would remember Thee.
 
 4  We know Thee now as risen,
 4     The Firstborn from the dead;
 4  We see Thee now ascended,
 4     The Church's glorious Head.
 4  In Thee by grace accepted,
 4     The heart and mind set free
 4  To think of all Thy sorrow,
 4     And thus remember Thee.
 
 5  Till Thou shalt come in glory,
 5     And call us hence away,
 5  To rest in all the brightness
 5     Of that unclouded day,
 5  We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,
 5     And here would seek to be
 5  More to Thy death conformed,
 5     While we remember Thee.

 1  Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present
 1     At Thy table freshly spread,
 1  Seated at Thy priceless banquet
 1     With Thy banner overhead.
 1  Precious moments at Thy table,
 1     From all fear and doubt set free;
 1  Here to rest, so sweetly able,
 1     Occupied alone with Thee.
 
 2  Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,
 2     Gladly by Thy Spirit led;
 2  Calmly in the blest remembrance
 2     Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.
 2  Lord, we take each simple token
 2     In fond memory of Thee,
 2  Muse upon Thy body broken
 2     And Thy blood shed on the tree.
 
 3  Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,
 3     In these chosen emblems here;
 3  In the bread and wine of blessing -
 3     Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!
 3  Lord, behold us met together,
 3     One in Thee, our risen Head,
 3  Thus we take the cup of blessing,
 3     Thus we share the broken bread.
 
 4  Lord, we know how true Thy promise
 4     To be with us where we meet,
 4  When in Thy loved name we gather
 4     To enjoy communion sweet;
 4  Dearer still that looked-for promise
 4     To each waiting, yearning heart,
 4  That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,
 4     Yes, "forever" where Thou art.

 5     Its myst'ry we shall know.

 1  Lord Jesus Christ, we would remember Thee,
 1  As, on the table, we the emblems see;
 1  Thy holy body shadowed in the bread,
 1  Thy precious blood is in the cup portrayed.
 
 2  Lord, we adore Thee for Thy matchless grace,
 2  That Thou, for us, didst take the servant's place;
 2  From Godhead's glory to the shameful tree,
 2  From wealth, so vast, to abject poverty!
 
 3  O Lamb of God, we join to bless Thy name,
 3  That Thou, on Calv'ry, bore our sin and shame;
 3  And, by Thy death, didst put our guilt away,
 3  Triumphant rose, our night to turn to day.
 
 4  We see Thee now, at God's right hand enthroned,
 4  Vested with honor and with glory crowned;
 4  Blessed Redeemer, Savior, Lord, to Thee
 4  Be all the glory, pow'r and majesty!

 1  When on Thy table, Lord, we gaze,
 1     We marvel at the signs:
 1  A loaf of bread, a cup of wine,
 1     Displayed as God designs.
 
 2  The loaf portrays the bread of life
 2     As heav'nly food to us,
 2  Imparted by Thy mystic death
 2     That we may share Thee thus.
 
 3  The portion is the cup divine,
 3     Composed of Jesus' blood;
 3  This cup of blessing we receive
 3     And gain what is of God.
 
 4  We eat of Thee, the Bread of life,
 4     By sharing here this bread;
 4  Thus we remember Thee in love
 4     And with Thyself are fed.
 
 5  We all enjoy the blessings gained
 5     By drinking of this cup;
 5  Thus we remember Thee with joy,
 5     Till we are taken up.
 
 6  By feasting on this bread and cup
 6     Thy death we now declare,
 6  And testify Thou art our life
 6     And all we daily share.
 
 7  We're waiting for that glorious hour,
 7     When in the fullest way
 7  We'll feed on Thee and feast with Thee
 7     And worship Thee for aye.

 1  Lord, we thank Thee for the table,
 1     With the bread and with the wine;
 1  At this table we enjoy Thee
 1     As the feast of love divine.
 1  We partake the bread, the emblem
 1     Of Thy body giv'n for us;
 1  And we share the wine, the symbol
 1     Of Thy blood Thou shedd'st for us.
 
Lo, the holy table!
With the sacred symbols;
Its significance in figure
Is unsearchable!
 
 2  By the death of Thy redemption,
 2     That Thy life Thou may impart,
 2  E'en Thyself to us Thou gavest
 2     That we share in all Thou art.
 2  By the bread and wine partaking,
 2     We Thy death display and prove;
 2  Eating, drinking of Thyself, Lord,
 2     We remember Thee with love.
 
Lo, the holy table!
With the sacred symbols;
Its significance in figure
Is unsearchable!
 
 3  By this bread which signifieth
 3     Thy one body mystical,
 3  We commune with all Thy members
 3     In one bond identical.
 3  By this holy cup of blessing,
 3     Cup of wine which now we bless,
 3  Of Thy blood we have communion
 3     With all those who faith possess.
 
Lo, the holy table!
With the sacred symbols;
Its significance in figure
Is unsearchable!
 
 4  Thou art our eternal portion,
 4     Here we take a sweet foretaste;
 4  We are waiting for Thy kingdom,
 4     And Thy coming now we haste.
 4  At Thy coming, in Thy kingdom,
 4     With all saints that overcome,
 4  We anew will feast upon Thee
 4     And Thy loving Bride become.
 
Lo, the holy table!
With the sacred symbols;
Its significance in figure
Is unsearchable!

 1  Dear Lord, we thank Thee for this bread,
 1     It is a sign divine;
 1  In it we see the mysteries
 1     Of God's unique design.
 
 2  This bread Thy body signifies,
 2     Which Thou hast giv'n for us,
 2  That we may share Thy life divine,
 2     Partaking of Thee thus.
 
 3  For us Thy body Thou didst break
 3     That Thou may thus impart
 3  Thyself as life to us that we
 3     May be Thy counterpart.
 
 4  This bread thus also signifies
 4     Thy body mystical,
 4  Of which we living members are,
 4     With Thee identical.
 
 5  Though we are many grains of wheat,
 5     Yet all one loaf, one bread;
 5  Remembering Thee in such a way,
 5     With Thee we all are fed.
 
 6  As of this bread we all commune,
 6     Thou, Lord, dost satisfy,
 6  With all the saints we fellowship,
 6     And Thee we testify.

 1  On the table of Thy love,
 1     With the bread, the cup is spread.
 1  By partaking of these signs,
 1     We with Thee are richly fed.
 1  How we thank Thee for this cup,
 1     For the cup of blessing, Lord,
 1  Cup of Thy Salvation full,
 1     Cup of all Thou dost afford.
 
 2  'Tis the blood Thou shedd'st for us,
 2     That our sins may be forgiv'n;
 2  'Tis the cov'nant made for us,
 2     That Thy blessings may be giv'n.
 2  Thou didst drink the cup of wrath,
 2     Thou hast tasted death for us,
 2  Thus the cup of blessing bought,
 2     As the portion gained for us.
 
 3  In this portion we have God,
 3     Whom we lost thru Adam's fall;
 3  By the shedding of Thy blood,
 3     God becomes our all in all.
 3  In this portion all we have -
 3     Life and peace, redemption sure;
 3  All that God has planned and willed,
 3     In this portion we secure.
 
 4  An eternal portion, 'tis,
 4     Overflowing cup divine;
 4  Heav'nly taste do we enjoy
 4     In this cup of God's design.
 4  Here in love we drink this cup
 4     In remembrance, Lord, of Thee;
 4  Thus in spirit we partake
 4     All Thy work on Calvary.

 1  As we're sharing of the cup,
 1     How can we restrain our praise;
 1  For the blood Thou shedd'st for us,
 1     Worth of which none can appraise.
 1  O how precious is Thy blood!
 1     All our problems it resolves;
 1  In Thine efficacious blood
 1     All our care and fear dissolves.
 
 2  It is by this blood of worth
 2     The new testament was made;
 2  For this better covenant,
 2     'Tis a sure foundation laid.
 2  We have been redeemed by God,
 2     Not with silver or with gold,
 2  But, Lord, with Thy precious blood,
 2     Which Thy love doth e'er unfold.
 
 3  For remission of our sins
 3     Thou hast shed Thy cleansing blood,
 3  Which for us has fully met
 3     All the righteous claims of God.
 3  Thou hast washed us from our sins
 3     In Thy pow'rful purging blood;
 3  And our conscience purged by it,
 3     Thus to serve the living God.
 
 4  By Thy separating blood,
 4     We have all been sanctified;
 4  'Tis by Thy preserving blood
 4     Holiness is testified.
 4  By Thy propitiating blood,
 4     We have all been justified;
 4  'Tis by Thy redeeming blood
 4     God is fully satisfied.
 
 5  Thru Thy blood shed on the cross,
 5     We are reconciled to God,
 5  That the way to contact Him
 5     May in peace by us be trod.
 5  By partaking of Thy blood,
 5     We have Thine eternal life;
 5  In Thy blood and life received,
 5     We have rest, free from all strife.
 
 6  Now, in heav'n Thy sprinkled blood
 6     Speaks for us of better things;
 6  Under its defending pow'r
 6     We are kept from Satan's stings.
 6  By Thine overcoming blood,
 6     We defeat the enemy;
 6  Over our accuser thus,
 6     We will have the victory.
 
 7  Of Thy blood, for fellowship,
 7     We commune with all the saints;
 7  Under its full covering,
 7     Our freed spirit never faints.
 7  How can we exhaust, in words,
 7     The account of Thy dear blood;
 7  We will need eternity
 7     To declare its boundless good.

 1  Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
 1  Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;
 1  Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,
 1  And all my weariness upon Thee lean.
 
 2  Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;
 2  Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;
 2  Here would I lay aside each earthly load;
 2  Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.
 
 3  I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
 3  Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
 3  It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;
 3  My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.
 
 4  This is the hour of banquet and of song;
 4  This is the heav'nly table spread for me;
 4  Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong
 4  The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.
 
 5  Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
 5  The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;
 5  The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,
 5  Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.
 
 6  Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,
 6  Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,
 6  Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,
 6  The Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love.

 1  Through the bread and cup, Lord Jesus,
 1     We Thy death exhibit here;
 1  What Thy love has done reviewing,
 1     All Thy suff'ring we revere.
 1  Bread and cup in separation,
 1     Show that Thou thru death hast gone;
 1  Grateful now, our spirit worships,
 1     And to Thee we give our song.
 
   Thine the cup of suff'ring,
   Mine the cup of blessing;
For Thy love in Thy redemption,
   Praise we ever sing!
 
 2  Thou, in love, hast shed Thy blood, Lord,
 2     Bringing us to God in grace,
 2  That from God, no longer severed,
 2     We may ever see His face.
 2  All God's righteousness and glory
 2     Have been fully satisfied;
 2  Thru Thy death's abundant merit
 2     We may now with God abide.
 
   Thine the cup of suff'ring,
   Mine the cup of blessing;
For Thy love in Thy redemption,
   Praise we ever sing!
 
 3  By Thy death the veil was riven,
 3     Opened was the holiest place,
 3  All the barriers have been broken;
 3     We approach the throne of grace,
 3  There receiving grace and mercy,
 3     Thus the timely need to meet,
 3  Drinking as of living water,
 3     Tasting God Himself replete.
 
   Thine the cup of suff'ring,
   Mine the cup of blessing;
For Thy love in Thy redemption,
   Praise we ever sing!
 
 4  Thou in grace hast so redeemed us,
 4     We the priests may be fore'er
 4  To fulfill that holy office,
 4     All God's sweetness thus to share.
 4  Such a blessing, such a mercy,
 4     From Thy death for us ensue;
 4  We would ever Thee remember
 4     Till with Thee we drink anew.
 
   Thine the cup of suff'ring,
   Mine the cup of blessing;
For Thy love in Thy redemption,
   Praise we ever sing!

 1  Sweet feast of love divine!
 1     'Tis grace that makes us free
 1  To feed upon this bread and wine,
 1     In mem'ry, Lord, of Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,
 1  We keep the memory adored,
 1  And show the death of our dear Lord
 1        Until He come.
 
 2  His body broken in our stead
 2  Is seen in this memorial bread,
 2  And so our feeble love is fed
 2        Until He come.
 
 3  The drops of His dread agony,
 3  His life-blood shed for us, we see;
 3  The wine shall tell the mystery
 3        Until He come.
 
 4  And thus that dark betrayal-night
 4  With the last advent we unite,
 4  By one blest chain of loving rite,
 4        Until He come.
 
 5  Until the trump of God be heard,
 5  Until the ancient graves be stirred,
 5  And with the great commanding word
 5        The Lord shall come.
 
 6  O blessed hope! with this elate;
 6  Let not our heart be desolate,
 6  But, strong in faith, in patience wait
 6        Until He come.

 1  O what a miracle, my Lord,
 1  That I'm in Thee and Thou in me,
 1  That Thou and I are really one;
 1  O what a wondrous mystery!
 
 2  For me Thy body Thou didst give,
 2  That I may ever share in Thee;
 2  For me Thy precious blood was shed,
 2  That from my sins I might be free.
 
 3  By resurrection Thou didst change
 3  Thy form and as the Spirit come;
 3  Thou wouldst that I be filled with Thee
 3  That all Thy riches mine become.
 
 4  Now as the symbols we behold,
 4  Thy loving self we see anew;
 4  We thank Thee for Thy heart's desire
 4  As all Thy travail we review.
 
 5  We eat the bread and drink the wine,
 5  And to Thy sweetness we are led;
 5  In spirit each receiving Thee,
 5  Our spirits with Thyself are fed.
 
 6  We long to eat and drink e'en more,
 6  To take Thyself in spirit thus,
 6  Till Thou shalt all our being fill
 6  And true remembrance have from us.

 1  Lamb of God! our souls adore Thee,
 1     While upon Thy face we gaze;
 1  There the Father's love and glory
 1     Shine in all their brightest rays;
 1  Thine Almighty pow'r and wisdom
 1     All creation's works proclaim;
 1  Heav'n and earth alike confess Thee
 1     As the ever great "I AM."
 
 2  Lamb of God! Thy Father's bosom
 2     Ever was Thy dwelling place;
 2  His delight, in Him rejoicing,
 2     One with Him in pow'r and grace;
 2  O what wondrous love and mercy!
 2     Thou didst lay Thy glory by;
 2  And for us didst come from heaven
 2     As the Lamb of God to die.
 
 3  Lamb of God! When we behold Thee
 3     Lowly in the manger laid,
 3  Wand'ring as a homeless stranger
 3     In the world Thy hands had made;
 3  When we see Thee in the garden
 3     In Thine agony of blood,
 3  At Thy grace we are confounded,
 3     Holy, spotless Lamb of God!
 
 4  When we see Thee, as the victim,
 4     Bound to the accursed tree,
 4  For our guilt and folly stricken,
 4     All our judgment borne by Thee,
 4  Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,
 4     Thou hast loved us unto blood;
 4  Glory, glory everlasting
 4     Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God.
 
 5  Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory
 5     Wilt to this sad earth return;
 5  All Thy foes shall quake before Thee,
 5     All that now despise Thee mourn;
 5  Then Thy saints all gathered to Thee,
 5     With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;
 5  Thine the praise and Thine the glory,
 5     Lamb of God, for sinners slain!

 1  Amazing words! - He 'gave Himself for me,'
 1  For me - rebellious, sinful, guilty me.
 1  For me the Savior bore the cross and shame;
 1  Rejoice, my soul, and bless His sacred name.
 
 2  For me He left His glorious throne above,
 2  For me revealed His Father's wondrous love,
 2  For me He tabernacled here below,
 2  For me He drank the bitter cup of woe.
 
 3  For me He was reviled, despised, betrayed;
 3  For me was scourged, condemned and crucified;
 3  For me He suffered on th' accursed tree
 3  For me - lost, wretched, vile, unworthy me.
 
 4  For me in agony He groaned and died,
 4  For me God's righteous law He satisfied,
 4  For me His precious blood He shed to save,
 4  For me He rose triumphant from the grave.

 1  When morning gilds the skies,
 1  My heart awaking cries:
 1  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 1  Alike at work and prayer
 1  To Jesus I repair:
 1  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
 2  To Thee, my God above,
 2  I cry with glowing love,
 2  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 2  The fairest graces spring
 2  In hearts that ever sing,
 2  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
 3  Does sadness fill my mind?
 3  A solace here I find,
 3  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 3  Or fades my earthly bliss?
 3  My comfort still is this,
 3  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
 4  When evil thoughts molest,
 4  With this I shield my breast,
 4  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 4  The powers of darkness fear,
 4  When this sweet chant they hear,
 4  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
 5  When sleep her balm denies,
 5  My silent spirit sighs,
 5  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 5  The night becomes as day,
 5  When from the heart we say,
 5  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 
 6  Be this, while life is mine,
 6  My canticle divine,
 6  May Jesus Christ be praised!
 6  Be this th' eternal song
 6  Through all the ages long,
 6  May Jesus Christ be praised!

 7     Lord, fill us by Thy Spirit now,
 7  That we may all be full of Thee,
 7     And all Thy riches thus avow.

 1  The Holy Spirit is today
 1     The Spirit of the life divine,
 1  He quickens us and gives us life,
 1     And makes us fit for God's design.
 
 2  As living water quenching thirst
 2     The stream of life He e'er supplies;
 2  Imparting Christ as life divine,
 2     My hungry heart He satisfies.
 
 3  Enlight'ning with the light of life,
 3     He chases darkness far away;
 3  Imparting Christ as light divine,
 3     He turns for us the night to day.
 
 4  He strengthens with the pow'r of life
 4     To energize our inner man;
 4  Imparting Christ as strength divine,
 4     He moves within us for God's plan.
 
 5  By law of life He liberates,
 5     And frees us from the law of sin;
 5  And with the nature all divine
 5     He regulates us from within.
 
 6  As Spirit of the life divine,
 6     Thru us abundant fruit He bears;
 6  Expressing God-like attributes,
 6     To others Christ in life He shares.
 
 7  The Spirit ever giving life
 7     Transforms me thus with life divine;
 7  Renewing all my inward parts,
 7     In life He makes Christ's image mine.
 
 8  Oh, by Thy Spirit, fill me, Lord,
 8     The Spirit of Thy life divine,
 8  And saturate me thoroughly
 8     Till all my life is filled with Thine.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Joys are flowing like a river,
 1  Since the Comforter has come;
 1  He abides with us forever,
 1  Makes the trusting heart His home.
 
Blessed quietness, holy quietness -
   What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
   How the billows cease to roll!
 
 2  Bringing life and health and gladness
 2  All around, this heavenly Guest
 2  Banished unbelief and sadness,
 2  Changed our weariness to rest.
 
Blessed quietness, holy quietness -
   What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
   How the billows cease to roll!
 
 3  Like the rain that falls from heaven,
 3  Like the sunlight from the sky,
 3  So the Holy Ghost is given,
 3  Coming to us from on high.
 
Blessed quietness, holy quietness -
   What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
   How the billows cease to roll!
 
 4  See a fruitful field is growing
 4  Blessed fruits of righteousness,
 4  And the streams of life are flowing
 4  In the lonely wilderness.
 
Blessed quietness, holy quietness -
   What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
   How the billows cease to roll!
 
 5  What a wonderful salvation
 5  Where we always see His face!
 5  What a perfect habitation!
 5  What a quiet resting place!
 
Blessed quietness, holy quietness -
   What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
   How the billows cease to roll!

 1  Our blest Redeemer ere He breathed
 1     His tender last farewell,
 1  A guide, a comforter, bequeathed
 1        With us to dwell.
 
 2  He came sweet influence to impart,
 2     A gracious, willing guest,
 2  While He can find one humble heart
 2        Wherein to rest.
 
 3  And His that gentle voice we hear,
 3     Soft as the breath of even,
 3  That checks each fault, that calms each fear
 3        With peace of heav'n.
 
 4  And every virtue we possess,
 4     And every victory won,
 4  And every thought of holiness,
 4        Are His alone.
 
 5  Lord, in Thy purity and grace,
 5     Our weakness pitying see;
 5  Oh, make our heart Thy dwelling place,
 5        And worthier Thee.

 1  Fainting in the desert,
 1  Israel's thousands stand
 1  At the rock of Kadesh.
 1  Hark! the Lord's command,
 1  Speak to the Rock,
 1  Bid the waters flow,
 1  Strike not its bosom
 1  Opened long ago,
 1  Speak to the Rock,
 1  Till the waters flow.
 
Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Doubt not the Spirit,
Given long ago;
Take what He waiteth,
Freely to bestow,
Drink till its fulness
All Thy being know.
 
 2  Blessed Rock of Ages,
 2  Thou art open still;
 2  Thy blest Holy Spirit
 2  All our being fill;
 2  Still Thou dost say,
 2  Wherefore struggle so?
 2  Call for the Spirit,
 2  Whisper soft and low,
 2  Speak to the Rock
 2  Bid the waters flow.
 
Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Doubt not the Spirit,
Given long ago;
Take what He waiteth,
Freely to bestow,
Drink till its fulness
All Thy being know.
 
 3  Oh, for trust more simple,
 3  Fully to believe;
 3  Oh, for hearts more childlike,
 3  Freely to receive;
 3  E'en as a babe,
 3  On its mother's breast,
 3  So on Thy bosom
 3  Let my spirit rest,
 3  Filled with Thy life,
 3  With Thy blessing blest.
 
Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Doubt not the Spirit,
Given long ago;
Take what He waiteth,
Freely to bestow,
Drink till its fulness
All Thy being know.

 1  Flow through me, Lord, a weak and earthly vessel,
 1     Cleansed by Thy blood, and quickened at Thy call.
 1  Flow through me, Lord, all utterly abandoned,
 1     To Thy dear service, great, or high, or small.
 
 2  Flow through me, Lord, with overflowing fulness,
 2     Make me to know Thine own deep love for souls.
 2  Work in me, Lord, the faith that moveth mountains,
 2     As power, Almighty power, my being holds.
 
 3  Flow through me, Lord, till sin in all its blackness
 3     To captives bound by Satan is revealed.
 3  Flow through me, Lord, till hearts are stricken, broken,
 3     And in Thy cleansing fountain saved and healed.
 
 4  Flow through me, Lord, till lagging souls are quickened,
 4     Till lives of failure sing the victory song,
 4  Till praise from lips long dumb and silent, open,
 4     And join with rapture earth's glad, cleansed throng.
 
 5  Flow through me, Lord, till waters from Thy fountain
 5     Shall slake the thirst of souls in deserts drear.
 5  Flow through me, Lord, till arid places blossom
 5     With roses fresh and sweet, and wondrous fair.
 
 6  Flow through me, Lord, set all my heart-strings thrilling,
 6     With Thine own love, so matchless, perfect, free.
 6  Flow through me, Lord, till naught in earth or heaven,
 6     Can satisfy my being, Lord, but Thee.

 1  Spring up, well, with water;

 1  Rivers of living water,
 1     Rivers that flow from the throne,
 1  Rivers o'erflowing with blessing,
 1     Coming from Jesus alone.
 
Rivers of living water,
   Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
   Send now the rivers through me.
 
 2  Whoso is thirsty come hither,
 2     Here is abundant supply;
 2  Water transparent as crystal,
 2     Come without money and buy.
 
Rivers of living water,
   Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
   Send now the rivers through me.
 
 3  Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,
 3     Make me a channel today;
 3  Empty me, fill me and use me,
 3     Teach me to trust and obey.
 
Rivers of living water,
   Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
   Send now the rivers through me.
 
 4  Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
 4     Through me the rivers can flow;
 4  Thus and thus only will others
 4     Learn Thy great fulness to know.
 
Rivers of living water,
   Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
   Send now the rivers through me.
 
 5  Now I surrender to Jesus,
 5     Here I lay all at His feet;
 5  Anything, anywhere only,
 5     Just for His service made meet!
 
Rivers of living water,
   Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
   Send now the rivers through me.

 1  Thou Breath from still eternity
 1     Breathe o'er my spirit's barren land -

 1  And where Thy living water flows

 2  Within me teach, and strive, and pray,
 2     Lest I should choose my own wild way.
 
 3  Thy Spirit, Stream by Thee, the Son,
 3     Is opened to us crystal pure,
 3  Forth flowing from the heavenly throne
 3     To waiting hearts and spirits poor;
 3  Athirst and weary do I sink
 3     Beside Thy waters, there to drink.
 
 4  My spirit turns to Thee and clings,
 4     All else forsaking, unto Thee;
 4  Forgetting all created things,
 4     Remembering only "God in me."
 4  Thy living Stream, Thy gracious Rain,
 4     None wait for these, and wait in vain.

 7     Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.
 
I am breathing out my sorrow,
   Breathing out my sin;
I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
   All Thy fulness in.

 1  "With one accord" within an upper room
 1  The faithful followers of Jesus met:
 1  One was the hope of every waiting soul,
 1  And on one object great each heart was set.
 
 2  "With one accord," until the mighty gift
 2  Of pentecostal power was outpoured;
 2  Then forth as witnesses possessed of God,
 2  To preach the resurrection of the Lord!
 
 3  "With one accord" within the house of God
 3  A hallelujah song is daily raised,
 3  As with the voice of one, from vocal hearts
 3  Christ Jesus' name is glorified and praised.
 
 4  Pour down Thy Spirit once again, dear Lord;
 4  Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain";
 4  Unite Thy people as the "heart of one,"
 4  And pentecostal days shall come again!

 6  Pass me not! Thy lost one bringing,
 6     Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
 6  While the streams of life are springing,
 6     Blessing others, oh, bless me.
 
Even me, even me,
Let some drops now fall on me.

 1  There shall be showers of blessing:
 1     This is the promise of love;
 1  There shall be seasons refreshing,
 1     Sent from the Savior above.
 
Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.
 
 2  There shall be showers of blessing -
 2     Precious reviving again;
 2  Over the hills and the valleys,
 2     Sound of abundance of rain.
 
Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.
 
 3  There shall be showers of blessing;
 3     Send them upon us, O Lord!
 3  Grant to us now a refreshing;
 3     Come, and now honor Thy Word.
 
Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.
 
 4  There shall be showers of blessing;
 4     O that today they might fall,
 4  Now as to God we're confessing,
 4     Now as on Jesus we call!
 
Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.
 
 5  There shall be showers of blessing,
 5     If we but trust and obey;
 5  There shall be seasons refreshing,
 5     If we let God have His way.
 
Showers of blessing,
   Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
   But for the showers we plead.

 1  Praise waiteth Thee in mercy's court,
 1     Where Thy beloved dwell;
 1  Ransomed, released from Satan's thrall,
 1     Their Hallelujahs swell.
 1  Come, as the Spirit, Lord, today,
 1     Our songs of praise inspire;
 1  Purge the iniquity, and touch
 1     Our lips with living fire.
 
 2  Praise for what Thou our God hast wrought;
 2     For promised blessings ours;
 2  The cloud on faith's horizon seen,
 2     The pentecostal showers.
 2  Praise for Thine own right way, dear Lord,
 2     We did not understand,
 2  But as Thy plans unfolded lie,
 2     We see Thy guiding hand.
 
 3  Enlarge our soul's capacity,
 3     Cut deeper channels, Lord;
 3  Room for the floods of blessing now,
 3     According to Thy Word.
 3  E'en while we praise, the heavens rend,
 3     In power come from on high;
 3  Make this another Pentecost,
 3     Answer our spirit's cry.

Come, oh Lord, Great Spirit, come!

Satisfy our soul's desire,

Waiting, waiting,

 1  God sent His mighty pow'r
 1     To this poor, sinful heart,
 1  To keep me every hour,
 1     And needful grace impart;
 1  And since His Spirit came,
 1     To take supreme control,
 1  The love-enkindled flame
 1     Is burning in my soul.
 
'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul.
 
 2  Before the cross I bow,
 2     Upon the altar lay
 2  A willing off'ring now,
 2     My all from day to day.
 2  My Savior paid the price,
 2     My name He sweetly calls;
 2  Upon the sacrifice
 2     The fire from heaven falls.
 
'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul.
 
 3  No good that I have done,
 3     His promise I embrace;
 3  Accepted in the Son,
 3     He saves me by His grace.
 3  All glory be to God!
 3     Let hallelujahs roll;
 3  His love is shed abroad,
 3     The fire is in my soul.
 
'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
   burning in my soul.

 1  Jesus, Thine all-victorious love

 1  Where the sprinkling of the blood is,
 1     There the ointment doth remain;
 1  Man in touch with God thus bringing,
 1     These the fellowship maintain.
 
 2  Blood, the emblem of redemption,
 2     Cleansing all the sins away;
 2  Ointment, symbol of the Spirit,
 2     Bringing God to man for aye.
 
 3  Blood doth speak of what God worketh,
 3     Ointment, what He is for us;
 3  By His work and by His person
 3     God Himself is blent with us.
 
 4  By the blood of Christ's redemption
 4     We are cleansed from all alloy;
 4  By th' anointing of the Spirit

 5  By the cleansing and anointing
 5     We with God are kept in one;
 5  By the blood and by the ointment
 5     God, our portion full, is won.
 
 6  We in faith must claim the cleansing
 6     When we need the precious blood,
 6  Ever to obey th' anointing,
 6     Thus to live and walk with God.
 
 7  God as light we'll then be knowing,
 7     God experience as love,
 7  And in God as life e'er growing,
 7     God as power we will prove.

 1  Divine anointing in me dwelleth,

 1  Of the Spirit born in spirit,

 1  Yet we still need more of Him, Lord,

 1  May Thou fill us with Thy Spirit,
 1     Give us life abundantly.
 
 2  Lord, we know the Spirit in us,

 2  That the riches of Thy fulness
 2     We may share thru what He is.
 2  Yet we still require Thy Spirit

 2  That for all Thy work and service,
 2     We may be equipped thereby.
 
 3  Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit,
 3     Clothe us with Thy pow'r of might;
 3  With this "mantle" of Thy power,
 3     We may then the battle fight.
 3  May Thy wind now blow upon us,
 3     Giving us the tongues of fire,
 3  That, as witnesses anointed,
 3     We'll fulfill Thy heart's desire.
 
 4  With the power of Thy Spirit,
 4     Still we need the gifts to share,
 4  That as members we may function
 4     And Thy testimony bear.
 4  By Thy Spirit's full outpouring,
 4     Lord, impart the gifts we need,
 4  That the building of Thy Body
 4     With Thy blessing might proceed.
 
 5  For Thy glory and Thy kingdom,
 5     May Thou hear Thy Body's cry!
 5  Now fulfill Thy holy purpose,
 5     All our hunger satisfy.
 5  May we all partake Thy Spirit,
 5     Him apply in many ways;
 5  His infilling, His outpouring,
 5     And His gifts to share always.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Christ indeed was born of Spirit
 1     When He came a man to be;
 1  And before His service started,
 1     With the Spirit filled was He.
 1  Yet He still received the baptism
 1     Of the Spirit from on high
 1  When He came to start His service
 1     And was clothed with pow'r thereby.
 
 2  Peter and the Lord's disciples
 2     All were Spirit born and filled,
 2  Breathing in the Holy Spirit
 2     As on them Christ breathed and willed.
 2  Yet they still received the baptism
 2     Of the Spirit from on high
 2  When they were equipped for service,
 2     And were clothed with pow'r thereby.
 
 3  Saul of Tarsus, the Ephesians,
 3     And Samaritans believed;
 3  Thus by Spirit generated,
 3     Of His fulness they received.
 3  Yet they still received the baptism
 3     Of the Spirit from on high
 3  When some laid their hands upon them,
 3     And were clothed with pow'r thereby.
 
 4  We are also born of Spirit
 4     On the day when we believe,
 4  And of Him we now are drinking
 4     As we daily Him receive.
 4  Yet we also must be baptized
 4     With the Spirit from on high,
 4  Thus to be equipped for service,
 4     And be clothed with pow'r thereby.
 
 5  Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit!
 5     This is what we need today;
 5  Clothe us with Thy heav'nly power,
 5     Bring us under its full sway.
 5  Oh, baptize us in this hour!
 5     This is all our earnest cry;
 5  Now on us repeat Thine answer,
 5     Clothe with power from on high.

 1  Lord, we come to Thee, and with liberty
 1     Claim we now from Thee pow'r of might;

Power! power! clothe us with Thy power!
With Thy mighty power from on high!
Power! power! clothe us with Thy power!
Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!

Shower! shower! pour on us Thy shower!
Pour Thy heav'nly shower from on high!
Shower! shower! pour on us Thy shower!
Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!

To proclaim Thy message from on high!
Fire! fire! give us tongues of fire!
Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!

Give us Thy power, give even now,
   Clothe us with pow'r today.

Act on this fact by living faith;
      Act now! act now!
Act on this accomplished fact by faith.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Christ the Savior hath ascended
 1     To the heavens far above,
 1  Crowned with glory and with honor
 1     By the Father God in love;
 1  He hath made Him Head of all things,
 1     His supremacy to prove.
 
 2  From this Christ to God ascended
 2     Hath the Spirit been outpoured,
 2  Poured upon the Church, His Body,
 2     That His members be empow'red;
 2  Thus the Lord of all in heaven
 2     Thru His Church will be adored.
 
 3  In the flesh by incarnation,
 3     Into man He God hath brought;
 3  By His death and resurrection,
 3     Into God He man hath brought;
 3  God and man together mingled,
 3     In Himself is fully wrought.
 
 4  Now in heaven by ascension
 4     He is seated on the throne;
 4  All the lordship, all the headship,
 4     He Himself doth fully own;
 4  And by pouring out His Spirit,
 4     He as such might be made known.
 
 5  By this outpour, His descension
 5     On the Church was realized;
 5  'Tis by this, that in His Spirit
 5     All the Church He hath baptized;
 5  Thus the baptism of the Spirit
 5     Was forever actualized.
 
 6  Hallelujah, 'tis accomplished,
 6     And accomplished once for all!
 6  Hallelujah, we're included,
 6     All included, great or small!
 6  Praise Him, He hath sent the Spirit
 6     And baptized the Church withal!

 1  The Spirit of life is within us today,
 1  Who's likened to water our thirst to allay;
 1  Of Him we may drink and be filled thus with Him,
 1  Until as a river He flows from within.
 
 2  The Spirit of pow'r comes upon us today,
 2  Who's likened to clothing ourselves to array;
 2  In Him we are baptized, with Him we are dressed,
 2  For service equipping with power possessed.
 
 3  The Spirit of life is as breath glorious,
 3  As spirit of life it is breathed into us;
 3  The Spirit of pow'r doth the wind typify,
 3  Which bloweth upon us with pow'r from on high.
 
 4  Into His disciples the risen Lord breathed,
 4  The Spirit of life thus to them He bequeathed;
 4  Th' ascended Lord poured at the Pentecost hour
 4  Upon His disciples the Spirit of pow'r.
 
 5  The Spirit of life is within as the life,
 5  The Spirit of power is giv'n for this life;
 5  As blowing of wind brings the fresh air to breathe,
 5  The Spirit of power to life doth bequeath.
 
 6  These are not two spirits apart and afar,
 6  But of the one Spirit the two functions are,
 6  To clothe us with God and to fill us within,
 6  That we may be thoroughly mingled with Him.
 
 7  Lord, fill with Thy Spirit of life every part,
 7  That we may grow up in Thy life as Thou art;
 7  And clothe us without with Thy Spirit of pow'r
 7  Thy will to fulfill in Thy service each hour.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  First the blood, and then the ointment,
 1     Cleansing, then anointing comes;
 1  If we pass not thru Golgotha,
 1     Ne'er to Pentecost we'll come.
 1  If the blood has never cleansed us,
 1     Ne'er the Spirit's pow'r we'll know,
 1  If for Christ we'd truly witness,
 1     Self-life to the Cross must go.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.
 
 2  Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten,
 2     That the living water flow;
 2  Without death the Spirit's fulness
 2     Ne'er could dwell in man below.
 2  If with Christ we die completely,
 2     Willing thus our all to lose,
 2  He will clothe us with His power
 2     And to win the world will use.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.
 
 3  First the altar, then the fire,
 3     If no loss, there'll be no gain;
 3  If our all has not been offered,
 3     To the throne we'll ne'er attain.
 3  If to sacrifice we're willing,
 3     All forsaking, God t'obey,
 3  He to us will be committed
 3     And thru us His pow'r display.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.
 
 4  First we must prepare the vessels
 4     That the Oil they may contain;
 4  Dig the valley full of ditches
 4     That they may be filled with Rain.
 4  First we must go thru the Jordan
 4     Ere anointed from above;
 4  First in death we must be baptized,
 4     Then experience the Dove.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.
 
 5  When we see the ripened harvest
 5     Of the golden countryside,
 5  We may know that many seeds have
 5     Fallen to the earth and died.
 5  Ere the fruit of life may blossom,
 5     We must surely suffer death;
 5  If with Christ we've not been buried,
 5     We'll not feel the Spirit's breath.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.
 
 6  Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,
 6     Help me go the narrow way;
 6  Deal with pride and make me willing
 6     Thus to suffer, Thee t'obey.
 6  I for greater power pray not,
 6     Deeper death is what I need;
 6  All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,
 6     Work in me - for this I plead.
 
Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
Put my soul-life all away;
Make me any price to pay,
Full anointing to receive.

 1  Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,
 1     Wash all my sins away,
 1  That with Thy Holy Spirit
 1     Thou may anoint, I pray.
 1  My service, I confess, Lord,
 1     Is failure-full and weak;
 1  The filling of Thy Spirit
 1     To live for Thee I seek.
 
Oh, from myself deliver,
   From all its misery;
I'd henceforth be forever
   Completely filled with Thee.
 
 2  Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,
 2     It yearns and pants for Thee;
 2  The filling of Thy Spirit
 2     Is now my fervent plea.
 2  Within the smitten Rock, Lord,
 2     I would entirely hide;
 2  Pour thru Thy living water,
 2     Till I am satisfied.
 
Oh, from myself deliver,
   From all its misery;
I'd henceforth be forever
   Completely filled with Thee.
 
 3  How cold my heart has been, Lord,
 3     How slow obeying Thee;
 3  So fill me with Thy Spirit,
 3     I'll ne'er rebellious be.
 3  I lie upon Thy altar
 3     And dare not move away;
 3  Oh, may Thy flame descending
 3     Consume my all, I pray.
 
Oh, from myself deliver,
   From all its misery;
I'd henceforth be forever
   Completely filled with Thee.
 
 4  Oh, may Thy Cross within me
 4     Deepen its work and burn,
 4  In me enlarge Thy measure,
 4     And me to ashes turn.
 4  Oh, may Thy Spirit fill me
 4     Each day more than before,
 4  And may Thy living water
 4     On me and thru me pour.
 
Oh, from myself deliver,
   From all its misery;
I'd henceforth be forever
   Completely filled with Thee.

 1  Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger
 1     Of the heart that seeks Thee now;
 1  How my soul hath long been craving
 1     What Thou only canst bestow.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 2  Failure in my walk and witness,
 2     Failure in my work I see;
 2  Fruitless toil, un-Christlike living,
 2     Calling forth no praise to Thee.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 3  Now to Thee my soul confesses
 3     All its failure, all its sin;
 3  All the pride, the self-contentment,
 3     All the "secret faults" within.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 4  Save me from myself, my Father,
 4     From each subtle form of pride;
 4  Lead me now with Christ to Calvary,
 4     Show me I with Him have died.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 5  No more let it be my working,
 5     Nor my wisdom, love, or power,
 5  But the life of Jesus only,
 5     Passing through me hour by hour.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 6  Let the fulness of Thy Spirit
 6     Resting on Him cover me,
 6  That the witness borne to others.
 6     May bring glory, Lord, to Thee.
 
Seeking now, seeking now,
Let Thy Spirit meet me now.
 
 7  Father, in Thy Son's Name, pleading,
 7     I believe my prayer is heard;
 7  And I praise Thee for the answer,
 7     Resting simply on Thy word.
 
Praising now, praising now,
Thou hast answered, Lord, I know.

 1  Loved with everlasting love,
 1  Led by grace that love to know;
 1  Spirit, breathing from above,
 1  Thou hast taught me it is so.
 1  Oh, this full and perfect peace!
 1  Oh, this transport all divine!
 1  In a love which cannot cease,
 1  I am His, and He is mine.
 
 2  Heaven above is softer blue,
 2  Earth around is sweeter green;
 2  Something lives in every hue
 2  Christless eyes have never seen:
 2  Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,
 2  Flow'rs with deeper beauties shine,
 2  Since I know, as now I know,
 2  I am His, and He is mine.
 
 3  Things that once were wild alarms
 3  Cannot now disturb my rest;
 3  Closed in everlasting arms,
 3  Pillowed on the loving breast.
 3  Oh, to lie forever here,
 3  Doubt and care and self resign,
 3  While He whispers in my ear,
 3  I am His, and He is mine.
 
 4  His forever, only His:
 4  Who the Lord and me shall part?
 4  Ah, with what a rest of bliss
 4  Christ can fill the loving heart.
 4  Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
 4  Firstborn light in gloom decline;
 4  But, while God and I shall be,

 1  Come and rejoice with me!
 1  For once my heart was poor,
 1  And I have found a treasury
 1  Of love, a boundless store.
 
 2  Come and rejoice with me!
 2  I, once so sick at heart,
 2  Have met with One who knows my case,
 2  And knows the healing art.
 
 3  Come and rejoice with me!
 3  For I was wearied sore,
 3  And I have found a mighty arm
 3  Which holds me evermore.
 
 4  Come and rejoice with me!
 4  My feet so wide did roam,
 4  And One has brought me from afar,
 4  To find in Him my home.
 
 5  Come and rejoice with me!
 5  For I have found a Friend
 5  Who knows my heart's most secret depths,
 5  Yet loves me without end.
 
 6  I knew not of His love;
 6  And He had loved so long,
 6  With love so faithful and so deep,
 6  So tender and so strong.
 
 7  And now I know it all,
 7  Have heard and known His voice,
 7  And hear it still from day to day.
 7  Can I enough rejoice?

 1  Of Jesus' love that sought me,
 1     When I was lost in sin;
 1  Of wondrous grace that brought me
 1     Back to His fold again;
 1  Of heights and depths of mercy,
 1     Far deeper than the sea,
 1  And higher than the heavens,
 1     My theme shall ever be.
 
Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.
 
 2  He trod in old Judea
 2     Life's pathway long ago;
 2  The people thronged about Him,
 2     His saving grace to know.
 2  He healed the broken-hearted,
 2     And caused the blind to see;
 2  And still His great heart yearneth
 2     In love for even me.
 
Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.

 1  I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!

 1  I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
 1  Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
 1  I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
 1  That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.
 
O it is wonderful that He should care for me
   Enough to die for me!
O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
 
 2  I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
 2  To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
 2  That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
 2  Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.
 
O it is wonderful that He should care for me
   Enough to die for me!
O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
 
 3  I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
 3  Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
 3  No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
 3  And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.
 
O it is wonderful that He should care for me

 1  I stand amazed in the presence
 1     Of Jesus the Nazarene,
 1  And wonder how He could love me,
 1     A sinner condemned, unclean.
 
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!
 
 2  For me it was in the garden,
 2     He prayed: "Not my will, but Thine."
 2  He had no tears for His own griefs,
 2     But sweat-drops of blood for mine.
 
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!
 
 3  In pity angels beheld Him,
 3     And came from the world of light
 3  To strengthen Him in the sorrows
 3     He bore for my soul that night.
 
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!
 
 4  He took my sins and my sorrows,
 4     He made them His very own;
 4  He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
 4     And suffered, and died alone.
 
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!
 
 5  When with the ransomed in glory
 5     His face I at last shall see,
 5  'Twill be my joy through the ages
 5     To sing of His love for me.
 
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! How wonderful!
   Is my Savior's love for me!

 1  I am so glad that our Father in heav'n
 1  Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;
 1  Wonderful things in the Bible I see:
 1  This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
   Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
      Jesus loves even me.
 
 2  Though I forget Him and wander away,

 2  Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,
 2  When I remember that Jesus loves me.
 
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
      Jesus loves even me.
 
 3  Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,

 1  The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.
 
I love Him, I love Him,
Because He first loved me,
And purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.
 
 2  Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;

 1  And can it be that I should gain
 1  An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
 1  Died He for me, who caused His pain?
 1  For me, who Him to death pursued?
 1  Amazing love! how can it be
 1  That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
 
 2  'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!
 2  Who can explore His strange design?
 2  In vain the firstborn seraph tries
 2  To sound the depths of love Divine!
 2  'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
 2  Let angel minds inquire no more.
 
 3  He left His Father's throne above,
 3  So free, so infinite His grace;
 3  Emptied Himself of all but love,
 3  And bled for Adam's helpless race:
 3  'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
 3  For, O my God, it found out me.
 
 4  Long my imprisoned spirit lay
 4  Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
 4  Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
 4  I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
 4  My chains fell off, my heart was free,
 4  I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.
 
 5  No condemnation now I dread;
 5  Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
 5  Alive in Him, my living Head,
 5  And clothed in righteousness Divine,
 5  Bold I approach the eternal throne,
 5  And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

 1     Arise, my soul, arise!
 1     Shake off thy guilty fears;
 1     The bleeding Sacrifice
 1     In my behalf appears.
 1  Before the throne my Surety stands;
 1  My name is written on His hands.
 
 2     He ever lives above
 2     For me to intercede,
 2     His all-redeeming love,
 2     His precious blood to plead.
 2  His blood was shed for all our race,
 2  And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
 
 3     Five bleeding wounds He bears,
 3     Received on Calvary;
 3     They pour effectual prayers;
 3     They strongly speak for me.
 3  Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
 3  Nor let that ransomed sinner die!
 
 4     The Father hears Him pray,
 4     His dear anointed One;
 4     He cannot turn away
 4     The presence of His Son.
 4  His Spirit answers to the blood,
 4  And tells me I am born of God.
 
 5     To God I'm reconciled,
 5     His pardoning voice I hear;
 5     He owns me for His child,
 5     I can no longer fear.
 5  With confidence I now draw nigh,
 5  And Father, Abba, Father, cry.

 1  Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
 1  No riches of earth could have saved my poor soul.
 1  The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
 1  The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.
 
I am redeemed, but not with silver;
   I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price - the blood of Jesus,
   Precious price of love untold.
 
 2  Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
 2  The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown.
 2  The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
 2  The death of my Savior I only can own.
 
I am redeemed, but not with silver;
   I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price - the blood of Jesus,
   Precious price of love untold.
 
 3  Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
 3  The holy commandment forbade me draw near.
 3  The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
 3  The death of my Savior removeth my fear.
 
I am redeemed, but not with silver;
   I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price - the blood of Jesus,
   Precious price of love untold.
 
 4  Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
 4  The way to God's kingdom could not thus be bought.
 4  The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
 4  The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought.
 
I am redeemed, but not with silver;
   I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price - the blood of Jesus,
   Precious price of love untold.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  How should the Lord keep back His sword from blood?
 1  "The soul that sinneth it shall surely die:"
 1  But ah, can Justice make His counsels good?
 1  Can Law bring in the glory from on high?
 1  Grace must provide a Lamb - a Ransom find;
 1  Redeem by One whom death no more may bind.
 
 2  "One poor wise man" hath cried, O God, to Thee;
 2  His blood is counted precious in Thy sight.
 2  He liveth, and His name shall ever be
 2  Thy praise, Thy glory, Thy supreme delight.
 2  By Jesus' blood - that new and living way -
 2  God's priests shall now within the holiest stay.
 
 3  The blood of bulls and goats for ages failed
 3  To purge the conscience, burdened sore with sins;
 3  Thy precious blood, O Lamb of God, prevailed -
 3  Through Thee, sweet Peace her endless reign begins.
 3  Thy blood hath made redemption e'en for me;
 3  Complete I stand, O risen Christ, in Thee.
 
 4  The precious blood of Christ, it speaketh peace
 4  To guilty sinners, groaning 'neath their load;
 4  To captive spirits it proclaims release,
 4  And Pharaoh's slaves become the "hosts of God."
 4  His flesh is meat - His blood is drink indeed;
 4  He died, He rose, His people's cause to plead.
 
 5  Oh, precious blood! Poured freely forth for me,
 5  My sins are sunk beneath thy crimson tide.
 5  No more before th' Avenger's sword I flee!
 5  Christ is the Refuge-City, where I hide.
 5  My life's dark page, blood-sprinkled, gleameth white;
 5  My name shines forth in heaven in words of light.

 1  Grace! 'Tis a charming sound.
 1     Harmonious to the ear;
 1  Heav'n with the echo shall resound,
 1     And all the earth shall hear.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.
 
 2  'Twas grace that wrote my name
 2     In life's eternal book;
 2  'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
 2     Who all my sorrows took.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.
 
 3  Grace taught my wandering feet
 3     To tread the pilgrim road;
 3  And new supplies each hour I meet
 3     While pressing on to God.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.
 
 4  Grace taught my heart to pray,
 4     And made my eyes o'erflow;
 4  'Tis grace which kept me to this day,
 4     And will not let me go.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.
 
 5  Grace all the work shall crown
 5     Through everlasting days;
 5  It lays in love the topmost stone,
 5     And well deserves the praise.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.
 
 6  Oh, let that grace inspire
 6     My heart with strength divine;
 6  May all my powers to Thee aspire,
 6     And all my days be Thine.
 
All sufficient grace!
   Never powerless!
It is Christ who lives in me,
   In His exhaustlessness.

 1  Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,
 1     That saved a wretch like me!
 1  I once was lost, but now am found,
 1     Was blind, but now I see.
 
 2  'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
 2     And grace my fears relieved;
 2  How precious did that grace appear
 2     The hour I first believed!
 
 3  The Lord hath promised good to me,
 3     His word my hope secures;
 3  He will my shield and portion be
 3     As long as life endures.
 
 4  When we've been there ten thousand years,
 4     Bright shining as the sun,
 4  We've no less days to sing God's praise
 4     Than when we first begun.

 1  Sov'reign grace o'er sin abounding,
 1     Ransomed souls, the tidings swell;
 1  'Tis a deep that knows no sounding,
 1     Who its breadth or length can tell?
 1  On its glories, on its glories,

 1  On its glories, on its glories,

 2  What from Christ the soul can sever,

 2  Once in Him, in Him forever,
 2     Thus th' eternal cov'nant stands.
 2  None shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee
 2     From the Savior's mighty hands!
 2  None shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee
 2     From the Savior's mighty hands!
 
 3  Heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus,
 3     Long ere time its race begun;
 3  To His name eternal praises,
 3     O what wonders love has done!
 3  One with Jesus, one with Jesus,
 3     By eternal union one.
 3  One with Jesus, one with Jesus,
 3     By eternal union one.
 
 4  On such love, my soul, still ponder,
 4     Love, so great, so rich, so free;
 4  Say, while lost in holy wonder,
 4     Why, O Lord, such love to me?
 4  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 4     Grace shall reign eternally!
 4  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 4     Grace shall reign eternally!

 1  Saved to the uttermost, I am the Lord's;
 1  Jesus my Savior salvation affords;
 1  Gives me His Spirit a witness within,
 1  Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.
 
Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
   Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
   Jesus the Savior is mine!
 
 2  Saved to the uttermost; Jesus is near;
 2  Keeping me safely, He casteth out fear;
 2  Trusting His promises, how I am blest;
 2  Leaning upon Him, how sweet is my rest.
 
Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
   Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
   Jesus the Savior is mine!
 
 3  Saved to the uttermost: this I can say,
 3  "Once all was darkness, but now it is day."
 3  Beautiful visions of glory I see;
 3  Jesus in brightness revealed unto me.
 
Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
   Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
   Jesus the Savior is mine!
 
 4  Saved to the uttermost: cheerfully sing
 4  Loud hallelujahs to Jesus my King!
 4  Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by His blood,
 4  Cleansed from unrighteousness, glory to God!
 
Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
   Saved, saved by power divine;
Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
   Jesus the Savior is mine!

 1  Some day the silver cord will break,
 1  And I no more as now shall sing;
 1  But, O the joy when I shall wake
 1  Within the presence of the King!
 
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace:
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace.
 
 2  Some day my earthly house will fall,
 2  I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,

 2  Has now a place with Him for me.
 
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace:
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace.
 
 3  Or some day when my Lord will come,
 3  And called to meet Him I'll be blest,
 3  He then will say to me, "Well done,"

And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace:
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace.
 
 4  Some day, till then I'll watch and wait,
 4  My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
 4  That when my Savior I will greet,
 4  My faith will then be changed to sight.
 
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace:
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace.

 1  Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,

 1  Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
 1     Call for songs of loudest praise.
 1  Jesus sought me when a stranger,
 1     Wand'ring from the face of God;
 1  He, to save my soul from danger,
 1     Interposed His precious blood.
 
 2  O to grace how great a debtor
 2     Daily I'm constrained to be!
 2  Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
 2     Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
 2  Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,
 2     Meet for me Thy grace to prove,
 2  While I sing the countless treasure
 2     Of my God's unchanging love.
 
 3  Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
 3     Prone to leave the God I love:
 3  Take my heart, oh, take and seal it
 3     With Thy Spirit from above.
 3  Rescued thus from sin and danger,
 3     Purchased by the Savior's blood,
 3  May I walk on earth a stranger,
 3     As a son and heir of God.

 1  In loving-kindness Jesus came
 1     My soul in mercy to reclaim,
 1  And from the depths of sin and shame
 1     Through grace He lifted me.
 
From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!
 
 2  He called me long before I heard,
 2     Before my sinful heart was stirred,
 2  But when I took Him at His word,
 2     Forgiv'n, He lifted me.
 
From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!
 
 3  His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
 3     His hands by cruel nails were torn,
 3  When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
 3     In love He lifted me.
 
From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!
 
 4  Now on a higher plane I dwell,
 4     And with my soul I know 'tis well;
 4  Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
 4     He should have lifted me.
 
From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!

 1  Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
 1     One that never would run dry;
 1  Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
 1     Nothing seemed to satisfy.
 
Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
   Finding joy and pleasure
   In abounding measure
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.
 
 2  Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
 2     For I find a living Spring,
 2  And my cup of gladness now is running o'er,
 2     Jesus is my Lord and King.
 
Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
   Finding joy and pleasure
   In abounding measure
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.
 
 3  Here is sweet contentment as the days go by,
 3     Here is holy peace and rest;
 3  Here is consolation as the moments fly,
 3     Here my heart is always blest.
 
Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
   Finding joy and pleasure
   In abounding measure
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.
 
 4  Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
 4     While the endless ages roll;
 4  To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
 4     There to bathe my weary soul.
 
Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
   Finding joy and pleasure
   In abounding measure
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

 1  Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,
 1  Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;
 1  Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,
 1     None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.
 
I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
   For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
 
 2  Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,
 2  Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;
 2  Safe am I within the castle of God's word retreating,
 2     Nothing then can reach me, 'tis Beulah Land.
 
I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
   For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
 
 3  Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,
 3  I am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand;
 3  Here the sun is always shining, here there's naught can harm me,
 3     I am safe forever in Beulah Land.
 
I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
   For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.
 
 4  Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,
 4  Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;
 4  Dwelling in the spirit, here I learn of full salvation,
 4     Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
 
I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
   For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

 1  All my life long I had panted
 1     For a draught from some cool spring,
 1  That I hoped would quench the burning
 1     Of the thirst I felt within.
 
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.
 
 2  Feeding on the husks around me,
 2     Till my strength was almost gone,
 2  Longed my soul for something better,
 2     Only still to hunger on.
 
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.
 
 3  Poor I was, and sought for riches,
 3     Something that would satisfy,
 3  But the dust I gathered round me
 3     Only mocked my soul's sad cry.
 
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.
 
 4  Well of water, ever springing,
 4     Bread of life, so rich and free,
 4  Untold wealth that never faileth,
 4     My Redeemer is to me.
 
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  He lives, the great Redeemer lives,
 1  What joy the blest assurance gives!
 1  And now, before His Father, God,
 1  Pleads the full merits of His blood.
 
 2  Repeated crimes awake our fears,
 2  And Justice armed with frowns appears;
 2  But in the Savior's lovely face
 2  Sweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.
 
 3  Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;
 3  Above our fears, above our faults,
 3  His mighty intercessions rise,
 3  And guilt recedes, and terror dies.
 
 4  In every dark, distressful hour,
 4  When sin and Satan join their power,
 4  Let this dear hope repel the dart,
 4  That Jesus bears us on His heart.
 
 5  Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
 5  On Him our humble hopes depend;
 5  Our cause can never, never fail,
 5  For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Before the throne of God above
 1  I have a strong, a perfect plea;
 1  A great High Priest, whose Name is Love,
 1  Who ever lives and pleads for me.
 
 2  My name is graven on His hands,
 2  My name is written on His heart;
 2  I know that while with God He stands
 2  No tongue can bid me thence depart.
 
 3  When Satan tempts me to despair,
 3  And tells me of the guilt within,
 3  Upward I look, and see Him there
 3  Who made an end of all my sin.
 
 4  Because the sinless Savior died,
 4  My sinful soul is counted free;
 4  For God, the Just, is satisfied
 4  To look on Him and pardon me.
 
 5  Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!
 5  My perfect, spotless Righteousness,
 5  The great unchangeable I AM,
 5  The King of glory and of grace.
 
 6  One with Himself, I cannot die;
 6  My soul is purchased by His blood;
 6  My life is hid with Christ on high,
 6  With Christ, my Savior and my God.

Yea, justified! O blessed thought!

 1        Blessed be God, our God,

 1  The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
 1        Blessed be God, our God!

 3  'Tis this that silences each rising fear,

 4  Since Christ has died, and ris'n, and gone above,
 4  For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
 4        Who shall condemn us now?
 
 5        'Tis God that justifies!
 5  Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
 5  Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
 5        'Tis God that justifies!

 6  For us in might came forth the mighty One;
 6  For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
 6        The victory is ours!

 1  My faith has found a resting place,
 1     Not in device nor creed;
 1  I trust the Ever-living One,
 1     His wounds for me shall plead.
 
I need no other argument,
   I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
   And that He died for me.
 
 2  Enough for me that Jesus saves,
 2     This ends my fear and doubt;
 2  A sinful soul I come to Him,
 2     He'll never cast me out.
 
I need no other argument,
   I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
   And that He died for me.
 
 3  My heart is leaning on the Word,
 3     The written Word of God,
 3  Salvation by my Savior's name,
 3     Salvation through His blood.
 
I need no other argument,
   I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
   And that He died for me.
 
 4  My great Physician heals the sick,
 4     The lost He came to save;
 4  For me His precious blood He shed,
 4     For me His life He gave.
 
I need no other argument,
   I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
   And that He died for me.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
 1  When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
 1  When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
 1  Will your anchor drift or firm remain?
 
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.
 
 2  It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand,
 2  For 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand;
 2  And the cables passed from His heart to mine,
 2  Can defy the blast, through strength divine.
 
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.
 
 3  It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,
 3  When the breakers have told the reef is near;
 3  Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
 3  Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.
 
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.
 
 4  It will surely hold in the floods of death,
 4  When the waters cold chill our latest breath;
 4  On the rising tide it can never fail,
 4  While our hopes abide within the veil.
 
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.

 1  I hear the words of love,
 1  I gaze upon the blood,
 1  I see the mighty sacrifice,
 1  And I have peace with God.
 
 2  'Tis everlasting peace!
 2  Sure as Jehovah's Name,
 2  'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
 2  For evermore the same.
 
 3  The clouds may go and come,
 3  And storms may sweep my sky;
 3  This blood-sealed friendship changes not,
 3  The Cross is ever nigh.
 
 4  My love is ofttimes low,
 4  My joy still ebbs and flows,
 4  But peace with Him remains the same,
 4  No change my Savior knows.
 
 5  I change, He changes not;
 5  The Christ can never die;
 5  His love, not mine, the resting-place,
 5  His truth, not mine, the tie.
 
 6  The Cross still stands unchanged,
 6  Though heaven is now His home;
 6  The mighty stone is rolled away,
 6  But yonder is His tomb!
 
 7  And yonder is my peace,
 7  The grave of all my woes!
 7  I know the Son of God has come,
 7  I know He died and rose.
 
 8  I know He liveth now
 8  At God's right hand above;
 8  I know the throne on which He sits,
 8  I know His truth and love!

 1  I know not why God's wondrous grace

 1  Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
 1     Redeemed me for His own.
 
But "I know Whom I have believed

To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day."
 
 2  I know not how this saving faith
 2     To me He did impart,
 2  Nor how believing in His word
 2     Wrought peace within my heart.
 
But "I know Whom I have believed

 4  Of weary ways or golden days,

But "I know Whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day."
 
 5  I know not when my Lord may come,
 5     At night or noon-day fair,
 5  Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
 5     Or "meet Him in the air."
 
But "I know Whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day."

 1  A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
 1     A wonderful Savior to me;
 1  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
 1     Where rivers of pleasure I see.
 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
   That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
   And covers me there with His hand,
   And covers me there with His hand.
 
 2  A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
 2     He taketh my burden away;
 2  He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved.,
 2     He giveth me strength as my day.
 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
   That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
   And covers me there with His hand,
   And covers me there with His hand.
 
 3  With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
 3     And, filled with His fulness divine,
 3  I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
 3     For such a Redeemer as mine!
 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
   That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
   And covers me there with His hand,
   And covers me there with His hand.
 
 4  When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
 4     To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
 4  His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
 4     I'll shout with the millions on high.
 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
   That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
   And covers me there with His hand,
   And covers me there with His hand.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story

Sing it in the light of glory,

 2  "Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
 2  For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
 2  I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
 2  Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.
 
 3  "When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
 3  The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
 3  For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
 3  And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.
 
 4  "When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
 4  My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
 4  The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
 4  Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.
 
 5  "E'en down to old age all My people shall prove
 5  My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
 5  And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,
 5  Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.
 
 6  "The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
 6  I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
 6  That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
 6  I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake!"

 1  Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
 1  Through eternal ages let His praises ring,
 1  Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
 1     Standing on the promises of God.
 
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
 
 2  Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
 2  When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
 2  By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
 2     Standing on the promises of God.
 
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
 
 3  Standing on the promises I now can see
 3  Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
 3  Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
 3     Standing on the promises of God.
 
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
 
 4  Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
 4  Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
 4  Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
 4     Standing on the promises of God.
 
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.
 
 5  Standing on the promises I shall not fall,
 5  List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call.
 5  Resting in my Savior as my All in all,
 5     Standing on the promises of God. ?
 
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.

 1  When peace like a river attendeth my way,
 1     When sorrows like sea billows roll;

 1     "It is well, it is well with my soul!"
 
It is well with my soul!

 2  Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,

It is well, it is well with my soul!

 1  Years I spent in vanity and pride,
 1  Caring not my Lord was crucified,
 1  Knowing not it was for me He died
 1        On Calvary.
 
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
      At Calvary.
 
 2  By God's Word at last my sin I learned;
 2  Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
 2  Till my guilty soul imploring turned
 2        To Calvary.
 
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
      At Calvary.
 
 3  Now I've giv'n to Jesus everything,
 3  Now I gladly own Him as my King,
 3  Now my raptured soul can only sing
 3        Of Calvary.
 
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
      At Calvary.
 
 4  Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
 4  Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
 4  Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
 4        At Calvary!
 
Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
      At Calvary.

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!

Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
 
 2  'Tis done - the great transaction's done;

 3  Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
 3  Here have I found a nobler part,
 3  Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.
 
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
 
 4  High heav'n that hears the solemn vow,
 4  That vow renewed shall daily hear!
 4  Till in life's latest hour I bow,
 4  And bless, in death, a bond so dear.
 
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;

 1  Come in, O come! The door stands open now;
 1  I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou.
 1  The sun has set long since; the storms begin;
 1  'Tis time for Thee, my Savior, O come in!
 
 2  Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room;
 2  The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom,
 2  The table empty stands, the couch undressed;
 2  Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest!
 
 3  Yet welcome, and tonight; this doleful scene
 3  Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;
 3  This dark confusion e'en at once demands
 3  Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ord'ring hands.
 
 4  I seek no more to alter things, or mend,
 4  Before the coming of so great a Friend;
 4  All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill

 1  Thy mighty working let me feel,

 3  Less than Thyself, oh, do not give,
 3  In might Thyself within me live;
 3     Come, all Thou hast and art.
 
 4  My will be swallowed up in Thee,
 4  Light in Thy light still may I see
 4     In Thine unclouded face:
 4  Called the full strength of trust to prove,
 4  Let all my quickened heart be love,
 4     My spotless life be praise.

 1  Love Divine, all love excelling,
 1     Joy of heav'n, to earth come down;
 1  Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
 1     All Thy faithful mercies crown.
 1  Jesus, Thou art all compassion;
 1     Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
 1  Visit us with Thy salvation,
 1     Enter every trembling heart.
 
 2  Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit

 2  Let us all in Thee inherit,
 2     Let us find the promised rest.
 2  Take away the love of sinning;

 3  Come, Almighty, to deliver,

 3  May Thy presence e'er be with us,
 3     Never more Thy temples leave.
 3  Thee we would be always blessing,

 4  Finish, then, Thy new creation;

 4  Changed from glory into glory
 4     Till with Thee we take our place,
 4  Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
 4     Lost in wonder, love and praise.

Sin shall not have dominion over you!

 1  Let me love Thee, Thou art claiming
 1  Every feeling of my soul;
 1  Let that love in pow'r prevailing,
 1  Render Thee my life, my all;
 1  For life's burdens they are easy,
 1  And life's sorrows lose their sting,
 1  If they're carried, Lord, to please Thee,
 1  If their pain Thy smile should win.
 
Let me love Thee, Savior,
Take my heart forever;
Nothing but Thy favor
My soul can satisfy.
 
 2  Let me love Thee, come revealing
 2  All Thy love has done for me;
 2  Help my heart, so unbelieving,
 2  By the sight of Calvary:
 2  Let me see Thy love despising
 2  All the shame my sins had brought;
 2  By Thy torments realizing
 2  What a price my pardon bought.

Take my heart forever;
Nothing but Thy favor
My soul can satisfy.
 
 3  Let me love Thee, I am gladdest
 3  When I'm loving Thee, the best;
 3  For in sunshine or in sadness
 3  I can find in Thee a rest;
 3  But without Thee life is fading,
 3  Treasureless its choicest flowers;
 3  Taken are its gifts eternal;
 3  Left, its empty passing hours.
 
Let me love Thee, Savior,
Take my heart forever;
Nothing but Thy favor
My soul can satisfy.
 
 4  Let me love Thee, love is mighty,
 4  Swaying realms of deed and thought;
 4  By it I shall walk uprightly,
 4  I shall serve Thee as I ought:
 4  Love will soften every sorrow,
 4  Love will lighten every care,
 4  Love unquestioning will follow,
 4  Love will triumph, love will dare.
 
Let me love Thee, Savior,
Take my heart forever;
Nothing but Thy favor
My soul can satisfy.

 1  Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;
 1  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
 1  When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
 1  Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
 
 2  Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
 2  Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
 2  Change and decay in all around I see;
 2  O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
 
 3  Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;
 3  But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:
 3  Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;
 3  Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.
 
 4  I need Thy presence every passing hour:
 4  What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
 4  Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
 4  Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.
 
 5  I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
 5  Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
 5  Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
 5  I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

 1  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
 1  Naught of this world's delusive dream;
 1  I have renounced all sinful pleasure;
 1  Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.
 
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
 
 2  Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
 2  Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
 2  Must not my heart from Him e'er sever;
 2  He is my all, there's nothing between.
 
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
 
 3  Nothing between, like pride or station;
 3  Self-life or friends shall not intervene;
 3  Though it may cost me much tribulation,
 3  I am resolved; there's nothing between.
 
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
 
 4  Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
 4  Though the whole world against me convene;
 4  Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
 4  I'll triumph at last, with nothing between.
 
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

 7  Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
 7     Till Thine eternal light,

 7     Bursts on my open sight -

 5     From sacredness be free,
 5  But all my life, in every step,
 5     Be fellowship with Thee.

 1  My stubborn will at last hath yielded;
 1  I would be Thine, and Thine alone,
 1  And this the prayer my lips are bringing,
 1  "Lord, let in me Thy will be done."
 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
 
 2  I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary,
 2  The darksome path hath dreary grown,
 2  But now a light has ris'n to cheer me;
 2  I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.
 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
 
 3  Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior,
 3  Doth now embrace and compass me;
 3  All discords hushed, my peace a river,
 3  My soul a prisoned bird set free.
 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.
 
 4  Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,
 4  My wayward feet no more to roam;
 4  What pow'r from Thee my soul can sever?
 4  The center of God's will my home.
 
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.

 1  Oh, tame me, Lord! Rebellious nature calm,
 1        Oh, tame me, Lord!
 1  This heart, so tossed and filled with wild alarm,
 1        Oh, tame me, Lord!
 1  These human longings, let them end in Thee,
 1  And let me be Thy bondslave, even me!
 
 2  I will not ask Thee to account to me
 2        For aught Thou dost;
 2  For crosses sore, or paths I cannot see:
 2        But I will trust.
 2  No second causes shall perplex my soul,
 2  Or stay from yielding all to Thy control.
 
 3  The raging storm I dare not fight alone,
 3        Ah, show Thy face!
 3  Say, "It is I!" Thyself to me make known,
 3        Ah, show Thy face!
 3  Then what care I for darkest depths of woe?
 3  Thine arms, O Christ, shall fold me close, I know!
 
 4  Oh, save me, Lord! Subdue this stubborn will;
 4        Oh, save me, Lord!
 4  In spite of all, Thy purposes fulfill
 4        In me, Oh, Lord;
 4  I yield my self, and all I have and am,
 4  To follow Thee, Thou all redeeming Lamb!
 
 5  How can I fear? Thou art so near to me;
 5        How can I fear?
 5  I hear Thee say, "Believe, and thou shalt see!"
 5        How can I fear?
 5  I now believe, and trust Thy mighty power,
 5  To save, to heal, to keep this very hour!

 1  I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
 1     And it told Thy love to me;
 1  But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
 1     And be closer drawn to Thee.
 
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To Thy precious, bleeding side.
 
 2  Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
 2     By the pow'r of grace divine;
 2  Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
 2     And my will be lost in Thine.
 
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To Thy precious, bleeding side.
 
 3  O the pure delight of a single hour
 3     That before Thy throne I spend,
 3  When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
 3     I commune as friend with friend!
 
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To Thy precious, bleeding side.
 
 4  There are depths of love that I yet may know
 4     Ere Thee face to face I see;
 4  There are heights of joy that I yet may reach
 4     Ere I rest in peace with Thee.
 
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
   To Thy precious, bleeding side.

 1  Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live,
 1  From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
 1  O let not my heart be contented or rest
 1  When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.
 1  Each moment, each day, throughout suff'ring and pain,
 1  When nought in the world can give comfort or cheer,
 1  When sighing and weeping encompasses me,
 1  Lord, still all my sighing and wipe every tear.
 
 2  Each time when I dream of the goodness of life,
 2  I pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be;
 2  O do not allow me to choose by myself,
 2  Nor seek any pleasure that's other than Thee.
 2  Each night when alone in the stillness I lie,
 2  I pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near;
 2  Each morning ere dawn comes, while still in my sleep,
 2  Then whispering call me and open my ear.
 
 3  Each time, Lord, when reading in Thy holy Word,
 3  I pray that Thy glory may shine on each line,
 3  That clearly I'll see what a Savior I have
 3  And how great salvation that Thou hast made mine.
 3  When helpless I come, Lord, to kneel at Thy throne,
 3  I pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace;
 3  If thru my shortcomings Thou hear not my prayer,
 3  Withdraw not Thy presence, O hide not Thy face.
 
 4  Each time when of heavenly blessings I think,
 4  O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;
 4  My only hope here is Thy coming again,
 4  My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.
 4  Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live,
 4  From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
 4  O let not my heart be contented or rest
 4  When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.

 1  I'm pressing on the upward way,
 1  New heights I'm gaining every day;
 1  Still praying as I onward bound,
 1  "Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."
 
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith on Canaan's tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
 
 2  My heart has no desire to stay
 2  Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
 2  Though some may dwell where these abound,
 2  My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
 
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith on Canaan's tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
 
 3  I want to live above the world,
 3  Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
 3  For faith has caught the joyful sound,
 3  The song of saints on higher ground.
 
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith on Canaan's tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
 
 4  I want to scale the utmost height
 4  And catch a gleam of glory bright;
 4  But still I'll pray till rest I've found,
 4  "Lord, lead me on to higher ground.''
 
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith on Canaan's tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,

 1  O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;
 1  This is my constant longing and prayer;
 1  Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,
 1  Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.
 
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
 
 2  O to be like Thee! full of compassion,
 2  Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,
 2  Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
 2  Seeking the wand'ring sinners to find.
 
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
 
 3  O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,
 3  Holy and harmless, patient and brave;
 3  Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
 3  Willing to suffer, others to save.
 
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
 
 4  O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,
 4  Now to receive th' anointing divine;
 4  All that I am and have I am bringing;
 4  Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.
 
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
 
 5  O to be like Thee! While I am pleading
 5  Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.
 5  Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
 5  Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.
 
O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

 7     And reflecting more
 7  Glory unto glory,
 7     Boundless evermore.

 1  Earthly pleasures vainly call me,
 1     I would be like Jesus;
 1  Nothing worldly shall enthrall me,
 1     I would be like Jesus.
 
Be like Jesus, this my song,
   In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
   I would be like Jesus.
 
 2  He has broken every fetter,
 2     I would be like Jesus;
 2  That my soul may serve Him better,
 2     I would be like Jesus.
 
Be like Jesus, this my song,
   In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
   I would be like Jesus.
 
 3  All the way from earth to glory,
 3     I would be like Jesus;
 3  Telling o'er and o'er the story,
 3     I would be like Jesus.
 
Be like Jesus, this my song,
   In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
   I would be like Jesus.

 5     To glorify Thee till I die;

 1  Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
 1     For my very life art Thou;
 1  Thee I take to all my problems
 1     As the full solution now.
 1  Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
 1     In all things Thy will be done;
 1  I but a transparent vessel
 1     To make visible the Son.
 
 2  Consecrated is Thy temple,
 2     Purged from every stain and sin;
 2  May Thy flame of glory now be
 2     Manifested from within.
 2  Let the earth in solemn wonder
 2     See my body willingly
 2  Offered as Thy slave obedient,
 2     Energized alone by Thee.
 
 3  Every moment, every member,
 3     Girded, waiting Thy command;
 3  Underneath the yoke to labor
 3     Or be laid aside as planned.
 3  When restricted in pursuing,
 3     No disquiet will beset;
 3  Underneath Thy faithful dealing
 3     Not a murmur or regret.
 
 4  Ever tender, quiet, restful,
 4     Inclinations put away,
 4  That Thou may for me choose freely
 4     As Thy finger points the way.
 4  Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
 4     For my very life art Thou
 4  Thee I take to all my problems
 4     As the full solution now.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
 1     Lord, I would be blind once more,
 1  Lest I lose the loving Presence
 1     And Delight I knew before.
 
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.
 
 2  Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,
 2     I can see in paradise,
 2  But while here on earth His mercy
 2     For my blindness will suffice.
 
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.
 
 3  I no more would be delivered
 3     From my thorn, but look for grace,
 3  While within the veil His glory
 3     Shineth brightly on my face.
 
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.
 
 4  In the deep dark night, His beauty
 4     I by faith, not sight, may trace;
 4  He was ridiculed and hated,
 4     Yet I see His glorious face.
 
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.
 
 5  Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
 5     Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,
 5  Is the glory all transcending
 5     Shining from His thorn-crowned head.
 
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.

 1  One thing I of the Lord desire,
 1  For all my path hath miry been:
 1  Be it by water or by fire,
 1  Oh, make me clean, oh, make me clean!
 
So wash me, Thou, without, within,
Or purge with fire, if that must be;
No matter how, if only sin
Die out in me, die out in me.
 
 2  I watch to shun the miry way,
 2  And staunch the springs of guilty thought;
 2  But, watch and struggle as I may,
 2  Pure I am not, pure I am not.
 
So wash me, Thou, without, within,
Or purge with fire, if that must be;
No matter how, if only sin
Die out in me, die out in me.
 
 3  If clearer vision Thou impart,
 3  Grateful and glad my soul shall be,
 3  But yet to have a purer heart
 3  Is more to me, is more to me.
 
So wash me, Thou, without, within,
Or purge with fire, if that must be;
No matter how, if only sin
Die out in me, die out in me.
 
 4  Yea, only as this heart is clean
 4  May larger vision yet be mine,
 4  For mirrored in the depths are seen
 4  The things divine, the things divine.
 
So wash me, Thou, without, within,
Or purge with fire, if that must be;
No matter how, if only sin
Die out in me, die out in me.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Lord, reveal Thyself to me,
 1  That the flesh I'll fully know;
 1  May Thy grace so work in me,
 1  That in dust I'll lowly bow.
 1  How I long for victory,
 1  Yet, thru all my life, how weak!
 1  Evil things I cannot leave,
 1  Nor can do the good I seek.
 
 2  Inwardly I want the Lord,
 2  But my conduct hateful is;
 2  Though I would, I cannot change,
 2  O what real bondage 'tis!
 2  By God's law my sin's revealed,
 2  But the law of sin doth bind;
 2  Though I struggle to be free,
 2  No release my soul can find.
 
 3  Many times I fall and rise,
 3  Oft resolve, and often fail;
 3  Craving vict'ry, I retreat,
 3  And my sad defeat bewail.
 3  Truly I am sold to sin
 3  And completely powerless;
 3  There's no good within my flesh,
 3  All is dark and sinfulness.
 
 4  Now I know myself in part,
 4  And confess my helplessness;
 4  All my temperament is odd,
 4  All my life corrupted is.
 4  Subtle self I cannot trust,
 4  Nor to fleshly strength can cling;
 4  All my trust and all my hope
 4  Is in Jesus Christ my King.
 
 5  May the Cross put me to death
 5  That on Christ I may rely;
 5  May His Holy Spirit fill,
 5  That Himself I may apply.
 5  May His death so work in me
 5  Daily deeper than before,
 5  That my self may be destroyed
 5  And His life thru me may pour.
 
 6  O how bitter is my case!
 6  Who this wretched slave can free,
 6  Who deliver from this death,
 6  To a life of victory?
 6  Jesus shed His blood for me,
 6  Christ is now my holiness;
 6  I receive Him as my life
 6  And my portion measureless.
 
 7  Now I'm wholly sanctified,
 7  Selfless, I obey His word;
 7  Nevermore to feel ashamed
 7  When I come before the Lord.
 7  How transcendent is this life!
 7  Praise the Lord, He heard my cry
 7  And has made me wholly free.

 1  Seeking only Thee to know.
 
 2  Weaned from all my lordly self,
 2  Weaned from all the miser's pelf,
 2  Weaned from all the scorner's ways,
 2  Weaned from all the lust of praise.
 
 3  All that feeds my busy pride,
 3  Cast it evermore aside;
 3  Bid my will to Thine submit,
 3  Lay me humbly at Thy feet.
 
 4  Make me like a little child,
 4  Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;
 4  Seeing only in Thy light,
 4  Walking only in Thy might;
 
 5  Leaning on Thy loving breast,
 5  Where a weary soul may rest;
 5  Feeling well the peace of God
 5  Flowing from Thy precious blood.
 
 6  In this posture let me live,
 6  And hosannas daily give;
 6  In this temper let me die,
 6  And hosannas ever cry.

 1  My Savior, Thou has offered rest:
 1     Oh, give it then to me;
 1  The rest of ceasing from myself,
 1     To find my all in Thee.
 
 2  This cruel self, oh, how it strives
 2     And works within my breast,
 2  To come between Thee and my soul,
 2     And keep me back from rest.
 
 3  How many subtle forms it takes
 3     Of seeming verity,
 3  As if it were not safe to rest
 3     And venture all on Thee.
 
 4  O Lord, I seek a holy rest,
 4     A victory over sin;
 4  I seek that Thou alone shouldst reign
 4     O'er all without, within.
 
 5  In Thy strong hand I lay me down,
 5     So shall the work be done;
 5  For who can work so wondrously
 5     As the Almighty One?
 
 6  Work on, then, Lord, till on my soul
 6     Eternal light shall break,
 6  And, in Thy likeness perfected,
 6     I "satisfied" shall wake.

 1  There is a foe whose hidden pow'r
 1     The Christian well my fear,
 1  More subtle far than inbred sin,
 1     And to the heart more dear.
 1  It is the pow'r of selfishness,
 1     It is the willful I,
 1  And ere my Lord can live in me,
 1     My very self must die.
 
 2  There is, like Anak's sons of old,
 2     A race of giants still:
 2  Self-glorying, self-confidence,
 2     Self-seeking and self-will.
 2  Still must these haughty Anakims
 2     By Caleb's sword be slain,
 2  Ere Hebron's heights of heav'nly love,
 2     Our conqu'ring feet can gain.
 
 3  Oh, save me from self-will, dear Lord,
 3     Which claims Thy sacred throne;
 3  Oh! Let my will be lost in Thine,
 3     And let Thy will be done.
 3  Oh, keep me from self-confidence,
 3     And self-sufficiency;
 3  Let me exchange my strength for Thine,
 3     And lean alone on Thee.
 
 4  Oh, save me from self-seeking, Lord,
 4     Let me not be my own;
 4  A living sacrifice I come,
 4     Lord, keep me Thine alone.
 4  From proud vain glory save me, Lord,
 4     From pride of praise and fame;
 4  To Christ be all the honor given,
 4     The glory to His name.
 
 5  Oh, Savior, slay the self in me
 5     By Thy consuming breath;
 5  Show me Thy heart, Thy wounds, Thy shame,
 5     That self be put to death.
 5  When the Shekinah flame came down,
 5     E'en Moses could not stay;
 5  So let Thy glory fill me now,
 5     And self forever slay.

 1  Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet,
 1  Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet;
 1  Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,
 1  Lower and lower; be Thou all in all.
 
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!
 
 2  Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray,
 2  Losing the self-life still more every day;
 2  Weak and unworthy, we're looking above;
 2  Empty us wholly; then fill us with love.
 
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!
 
 3  Lower and lower; yet higher we rise,
 3  Lifted in Christ, freed from all the earth ties;
 3  Humbly we follow the way of the cross,
 3  Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.
 
Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
All the world's treasure counting but dross;
Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!

 1  O God, unblessing and unblest,
 1  A withered plant, but not at rest,
 1  A useless cumberer I'm found
 1  Upon Thy field, Thy purchased ground;
 1  And yet I pray - "Do not forsake me,
 1  But in Thy hand, O Savior, take me.
 
 2  As women take unbroken flax,
 2  As molders take unshapen wax,
 2  As smith, the iron, rough and cold,
 2  A useful instrument to mold,
 2  So in Thy skillful hands, O take me,
 2  And never let Thy love forsake me."
 
 3  Like rock uncrushed, the stubborn will,
 3  Though bearing gold is barren still;
 3  Like marble in the quarry rough,
 3  The natural heart is useless stuff;
 3  And so, I pray - "Do not forsake me,
 3  But with Thy hand, O Savior, break me.
 
 4  As mortars crush the hardest rock,
 4  As hammers break the stony block,
 4  As millstones bruise the finest wheat,
 4  As nuts are broken for their meat,
 4  So with Thy mighty hand, O break me,
 4  And never let Thy love forsake me.
 
 5  Though crushed and broken, yet I'm nought
 5  But fragments to the furnace brought;
 5  Though bruised, I have no worth to feed
 5  The multitudes that die in need;
 5  And so, I pray - "Do not forsake me,
 5  But meet for service, Savior, make me.
 
 6  As into useful forms the ore
 6  From molten scraps the molders' pour;
 6  As fire doth make the bruised wheat,
 6  When mixed and molded, fit to eat;
 6  So, fit for use by fire, O make me,
 6  And never let Thy love forsake me."

 1  Make me a captive, Lord,
 1  And then I shall be free;
 1  Force me to render up my sword,
 1  And I shall conq'ror be.
 1  I sink in life's alarms
 1  When by myself I stand,
 1  Imprison me within Thy arms,
 1  And strong shall be my hand.
 
 2  My heart is weak and poor
 2  Until it master find:
 2  It has not spring of action sure,
 2  It varies with the wind;
 2  It cannot freely move
 2  Till Thou hast wrought its chain;
 2  Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
 2  And deathless it shall reign.
 
 3  My power is faint and low
 3  Till I have learned to serve:
 3  It wants the needed fire to glow,
 3  It wants the breeze to nerve;
 3  It cannot drive the world
 3  Until itself be driven;
 3  Its flag can only be unfurled
 3  When Thou shalt breathe from heaven.
 
 4  My will is not my own
 4  Till Thou hast made it Thine;
 4  If it would reach the monarch's throne
 4  It must its crown resign;
 4  It only stands unbent
 4  Amid the clashing strife.
 4  When on Thy bosom it has leant,
 4  And found in Thee its life.

 1  Thou hidden love of God, whose height,
 1  Whose depth unfathomed no man knows,
 1  I see from far Thy beauteous light,
 1  Inly I sigh for Thy repose;
 1  My heart is pained, nor can it be
 1  At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.
 
 2  Thy secret voice invites me still
 2  The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove;
 2  And fain I would: but though my will
 2  Seems fixed, yet wide my passion rove;
 2  Yet hindrances strew all the way;
 2  I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray.
 
 3  'Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought
 3  My mind to seek her peace in Thee;
 3  Yet, while I seek but find Thee not,
 3  No peace my wand'ring soul shall see.
 3  Oh, when shall all my wand'rings end,
 3  And all my steps to Thee-ward tend!
 
 4  Is there a thing beneath the sun
 4  That strives with Thee my heart to share?
 4  Ah! Tear it thence, and reign alone,
 4  The Lord of every motion there.
 4  Then shall my heart from earth be free,
 4  When it has found repose in Thee.
 
 5  Oh, hide this self from me, that I
 5  No more, but Christ in me may live;
 5  My vile affections mortify,
 5  Nor let one darling sin survive.
 5  In all things nothing may I see,
 5  Nothing desire or seek but Thee.
 
 6  O Lord, Thy sovereign aid impart,
 6  To save me from low-thoughted care;
 6  Chase this self-will through all my heart,
 6  Through all its latent mazes there.
 6  Make me Thy duteous child, that I
 6  Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry.
 
 7  Each moment draw from earth away
 7  My heart which lowly waits Thy call;
 7  Speak to my inmost soul and say.
 7  "I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy All."
 7  To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice,
 7  To taste Thy love, be all my choice.

 1  Remove my covering, Lord,
 1  That I may see Thy light,
 1  And be deceived no more,
 1  But all things see aright.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 2  I hardly know myself;
 2  Deceived so much by pride,
 2  I often think I'm right
 2  And am self-satisfied.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 3  I know Thee even less;
 3  In doctrine, shallowly;
 3  True revelation lack
 3  Of Thy reality.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 4  As for Thy life within,
 4  In darkness I mistake -
 4  If spirit or the flesh,
 4  One for the other take.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 5  As for Thy way, O Lord,
 5  I often am not clear;
 5  I toward seclusion tend
 5  And from the pathway veer.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 6  As for Thy will for me,
 6  I do not know it well;
 6  I substitute my own
 6  And often would rebel.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 7  As for the church, I need
 7  Thy revelation more,
 7  The Body-life to know,
 7  Thy wisdom to explore.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.
 
 8  I long to be unveiled,
 8  In everything made clear,
 8  No more to be deceived
 8  Or to my pride adhere.
 
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.

 1  O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,
 1  When shall I find my willing heart
 1     All taken up by Thee?
 1  My thirsty spirit faints to prove
 1  The greatness of redeeming love,
 1     The love of Christ to me.
 
 2  Stronger His love than death and hell,
 2  Its riches are unsearchable:
 2     The first-born sons of light
 2  Desire in vain its depths to see;
 2  They cannot reach the mystery,
 2     The length, and breadth, and height.
 
 3  God only knows the love of God;
 3  Oh, that it now were shed abroad
 3     In this poor stony heart;
 3  For love I sigh, for love I pine;
 3  This only portion, Lord, be mine,
 3     Be mine this better part.
 
 4  Oh, that I could forever sit
 4  Like Mary, at the Master's feet;
 4     Be this my happy choice;
 4  My only care, delight, and bliss,

 1  O Lord, Thy boundless love to me
 1  No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
 1  Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,
 1  And reign without a rival there;
 1  Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;
 1  Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.
 
 2  Oh, grant that nothing in my soul
 2  May dwell but Thy pure love alone;
 2  Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,
 2  My joy, my treasure, and my crown;
 2  All coldness from my heart remove;
 2  May every act, word, thought, be love.
 
 3  O Love, how cheering is Thy ray,
 3  All pain before Thy presence flies;
 3  Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,
 3  Where'er Thy healing beams arise;
 3  Lord Jesus, nothing may I see,
 3  And naught desire, or seek, but Thee.

 1  My faith looks up to Thee,
 1  Thou Lamb of Calvary,
 1     Savior Divine;
 1  Now hear me while I pray;
 1  Take all my guilt away;
 1  Oh, let me from this day
 1     Be wholly Thine.
 
 2  May Thy rich grace impart
 2  Strength to my fainting heart,
 2     My zeal inspire;
 2  As Thou hast died for me,
 2  Oh, may my love to Thee
 2  Pure, warm, and changeless be,
 2     A living fire.
 
 3  While life's dark maze I tread,
 3  And griefs around me spread,
 3     Be Thou my Guide;
 3  Bid darkness turn to day,
 3  Wipe sorrow's tears away,
 3  Nor let me ever stray
 3     From Thee aside.
 
 4  All thru life's transient dream,
 4  Until death's sullen stream
 4     Shall o'er me roll,
 4  Blest Savior, with Thy love,
 4  Fear and distrust remove;
 4  Make me Thy grace to prove,
 4     Transform my soul.

 1  When I am in the natural man,
 1  How very strong I feel I am,
 1  I do not know, I cannot scan
 1        How weak I am.
 
 2  When in the world I have my life,
 2  I cannot sense my failure rife,
 2  But boasting in my earnest strife,
 2        I forward press.
 
 3  When I within the darkness dwell,
 3  My shallow state I cannot tell,
 3  I only think how I excel,
 3        And proudly dream.
 
 4  But when at last I come to Thee,
 4  Thy searching light uncovers me,
 4  I see what I could never see -
 4        My self exposed.
 
 5  I wither 'neath Thy piercing ray,
 5  And all my strength dissolves away,
 5  My self-esteem in dust I lay,
 5        And lowly bow.
 
 6  How blind and foolish is the pride
 6  With which my soul was fortified;
 6  From my dark heart, self-satisfied,
 6        It issued forth.
 
 7  There's not a thing that pride can claim,
 7  There's not a member but is lame,
 7  There's only deep regret and shame,
 7        How can I pray?
 
 8  Thy blood from judgment saveth me,
 8  Thy life from wrath delivers me,
 8  How filthy yet in poverty
 8        I really am.
 
 9  I want to pray, but faith have not,
 9  I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.
 9  Oh, canst Thou e'er renew my heart,
 9        Have mercy, Lord!

 1  Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me,
 1  As some strong tide it presseth on its way,
 1  Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul,
 1  Yearning to sweep all barriers away.
 
 2  Shall I not yield to that constraining power?
 2  Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?
 2  My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me,
 2  Life cannot be as it hath hither been.
 
 3  Break through my nature, mighty, heavenly love,
 3  Clear every avenue of thought and brain,
 3  Flood my affections, purify my will,
 3  Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.
 
 4  Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God,
 4  Forth from my life, spontaneous and free,
 4  Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace.
 4  Loving, because God loved, eternally.

 1  I am the Lord's! O joy beyond expression,
 1     O sweet response to voice of love Divine;
 1  Faith's joyous "Yes" to the assuring whisper,
 1     "Fear not! I have redeemed thee; thou art Mine."
 
 2  I am the Lord's! It is the glad confession
 2     Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,
 2  When love's "I will" accepted Him forever,
 2     "The Lord's," to love, to honor and obey.
 
 3  I am the Lord's! Yet teach me what it meaneth,
 3     All it involves of love and loyalty,
 3  Of holy service, absolute surrender,
 3     And unreserved obedience unto Thee.
 
 4  I am the Lord's! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,
 4     O seal them irrecoverably Thine;
 4  As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fulness
 4     Forever and forevermore art mine.

 1  Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,

 1  When I let the Savior's pity
 1  Plead in vain, and proudly answered,
 1     All of self, and none of Thee,
 1     All of self, and none of Thee.
 
 2  Yet He found me; I beheld Him
 2     Bleeding on the cursed tree;

 2  And my wistful heart said faintly,
 2     Some of self, and some of Thee,

 3  Day by day His tender mercy,
 3     Healing, helping, full and free,
 3  Sweet and strong, and ah! So patient,
 3  Brought me lower while I whispered,
 3     Less of self, and more of Thee,
 3     Less of self, and more of Thee.
 
 4  Higher than the highest heavens,
 4     Deeper than the deepest sea,
 4  Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered;

 1  Thy Life was giv'n for me,

 1  That I might ransomed be,
 1  And quickened from the dead;
 1  Thy Life was giv'n for me, for me;
 1  What have I giv'n for Thee?

 2  Have I spent one for Thee?

 3  Were left for earthly night,
 3  For wanderings sad and lone;
 3  Yea, all was left for me, for me;
 3  Have I left aught for Thee?
 
 4  Thou, Lord, hast borne for me
 4  More than my tongue can tell
 4  Of bitterest agony,
 4  To rescue me from hell;
 4  Thou suff'redst all for me, for me;
 4  What have I borne for Thee?
 
 5  And Thou hast brought to me
 5  Down from Thy home above
 5  Salvation full and free,
 5  Thy pardon and Thy love;
 5  Great gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;
 5  What have I brought to Thee?
 
 6  Oh, let my life be given,
 6  My years for Thee be spent;
 6  World-fetters all be riven,
 6  And joy with suff'ring blent;
 6  Thou gav'st Thyself for me, for me,
 6  I give myself to Thee.

 1  Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
 1     Is not thine a captured heart?
 1  Chief among ten thousand own Him;
 1     Joyful choose the better part.
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 2  Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
 2     Lovely things of time and sense;
 2  Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
 2     Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 3  What has stripped the seeming beauty
 3     From the idols of the earth?
 3  Not a sense of right or duty,
 3     But the sight of peerless worth.
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 4  Not the crushing of those idols,
 4     With its bitter void and smart;
 4  But the beaming of His beauty,
 4     The unveiling of His heart.
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 5  Who extinguishes their taper
 5     Till they hail the rising sun?
 5  Who discards the garb of winter
 5     Till the summer has begun?
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 6  'Tis that look that melted Peter,
 6     'Tis that face that Stephen saw,
 6  'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
 6     Can alone from idols draw:
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.
 
 7  Draw and win and fill completely,
 7     Till the cup o'erflow the brim;
 7  What have we to do with idols
 7     Who have companied with Him?
 
Captivated by His beauty,
Worthy tribute haste to bring;
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.

 1  I've turned my back upon the world
 1     With all its idle pleasures,
 1  And set my heart on better things,
 1     On higher, holier treasures;
 1  No more its glitter and its glare,
 1     And vanity shall blind me;
 1  I've crossed the separating line,
 1     And left the world behind me.
 
      Far, far behind me!
      Far, far behind me!
I've crossed the separating line,
   And left the world behind me.
 
 2  I've left the old sad life of sin,
 2     Its follies all forsaken;
 2  My standing place is now in Christ,
 2     His holy vows I've taken;
 2  Beneath the standard of the cross
 2     The world henceforth shall find me;
 2  I've passed in Christ from death to life,
 2     And left the world behind me.
 
      Far, far behind me!
      Far, far behind me!
I've passed in Christ from death to life,
   And left the world behind me.
 
 3  My soul shall ne'er return again
 3     Back to its former station,
 3  For here alone is perfect peace,
 3     And rest from condemnation;
 3  I've made exchange of masters now,
 3     The vows of glory bind me,
 3  And once for all I've left the world,
 3     Yes, left the world behind me.
 
      Far, far behind me!
      Far, far behind me!
And once for all I've left the world,
   Yes, left the world behind me.
 
 4  My choice is made forevermore,
 4     I want no other Savior;
 4  I ask no purer happiness
 4     Than His sweet love and favor;
 4  My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
 4     No more the world shall blind me;
 4  I've crossed the Red Sea of His death,
 4     And left the world behind me.
 
      Far, far behind me!
      Far, far behind me!
I've crossed the Red Sea of His death,
   And left the world behind me.

 4  All my plans and longings
 4     Lost in His sweet will,
 4  Having nothing, owning
 4     All things in Him still.
 
Utterly abandoned
   To the Lord of all,
Seeking all His fulness,
   Answ'ring His dear call.
 
 5  Utterly abandoned!
 5     'Tis so sweet to be
 5  Captive in His love-bonds,
 5     Yet so wondrous free;
 5  Free from sin's dominion,
 5     Free from doubt and fear,
 5  Free from every worry,
 5     Burden, grief or care.
 
Utterly abandoned
   To the Lord of all,
Seeking all His fulness,
   Answ'ring His dear call.
 
 6  Utterly abandoned!
 6     Oh, the rest is sweet,
 6  Waiting in His presence
 6     At His blessed feet;
 6  Waiting for the filling
 6     Of the Host divine,
 6  Who my inward parts shall
 6     Perfectly refine.
 
Utterly abandoned

 7     With His presence sweet!
 7  I, in Him, am blessed!
 7     I, in Him, complete!
 7  Now, the light within me
 7     Never shall grow dim
 7  While abandoned ever,
 7     Living unto Him!
 
Utterly abandoned
   To the Lord of all,
Seeking all His fulness,
   Answ'ring His dear call.

 1  Holy, happy separation!
 1  They alone are truly blest
 1  Who from all besides retiring,
 1  And Himself alone desiring
 1  Find in Jesus only rest,
 1  Find in Jesus only rest.
 
 2  Jesus calls to separation,
 2  And Himself hath led the way;
 2  His own life the explanation,
 2  His own life the illustration
 2  Who is ready to obey?
 2  Who is ready to obey?
 
 3  Blessed Jesus, make us willing,
 3  Thus without the camp to go
 3  Unto Thee in glad subjection,
 3  Unto Thee in Thy rejection,
 3  Unto Thee from all below,
 3  Unto Thee from all below!
 
 4  Separate from all that grieves Thee,
 4  Separate from sinners too;
 4  Yet, like Thee, for sinners caring,
 4  And, like Thee, with sinners bearing,
 4  Asking, "What would Jesus do?"
 4  Asking, "What would Jesus do?"
 
 5  Unto Thee! Beloved Master,
 5  Nearer, nearer let us be;
 5  Unto Thee in consecration,
 5  Unto Thee in separation,
 5  Ever, only, unto Thee,
 5  Ever, only, unto Thee!

My all is on the altar;
I'm waiting for the fire;
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting;

 1  You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase,
 1     And have earnestly, fervently prayed;
 1  But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest,
 1     Until all on the altar is laid.
 
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
   Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
   As you yield Him your body and soul.
 
 2  Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
 2     And have peace and contentment alway;
 2  You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill;
 2     On the altar you all you must lay.
 
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
   Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
   As you yield Him your body and soul.
 
 3  Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow
 3     Of the blessings for which we have prayed,
 3  Till our body and soul He doth fully control,
 3     And our all on the altar is laid.
 
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
   Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
   As you yield Him your body and soul.
 
 4  Who can tell all the love He will send from above!
 4     Oh, how happy our heart will be made!
 4  Oh, what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet,
 4     When our all on the altar is laid!
 
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
   Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
   As you yield Him your body and soul.

 1  Tell me not of earthly pleasures,

 1  I am weaned from sinful idols;

I am not my own,

 4     How can I, Lord, withhold
 4        Life's brightest hour
 4     From Thee; or gathered gold,
 4        Or any power?
 4  Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee,
 4  When Thou hast given Thine own dear Self to me?
 
 5     I pray Thee, Savior, keep
 5        Me in Thy love,
 5     Until the world Thou sweep
 5        And me remove
 5  To that fair realm, where, sin and sorrow o'er,
 5  Thou and Thine own are one for evermore.

 1  Every thread I wind this day,
 1  Every footstep on life's way,
 1  Every clod I shall unearth,
 1  Every task, whate'er its worth:
 1  Only for God's glory living,
 1  Blessing, praise and honor giving!
 
 2  All the burdens of the day,
 2  All the words which I shall say,
 2  All the works my God may send,
 2  All the hours in rest I spend:
 2  Ever for His glory living,
 2  Blessing, praise and honor giving!
 
 3  Every blood-drop in the heart,
 3  Every grief and aching smart,
 3  Every bitter pulse of pain,
 3  Every hour of joy again:
 3  Only for God's glory living,
 3  Blessing, praise and honor giving!
 
 4  As I take my daily food,
 4  Greet another on life's road.
 4  Pluck a flower beside the way,
 4  Stoop to lift a wisp of hay;
 4  Ever for God's glory living,
 4  Blessing, praise and honor giving!

 5  All, from deeds of little worth,
 5  To the greatest things on earth;
 5  Mine to build some world to be,
 5  Or to lie and gaze on Thee:
 5  For Thy glory daily living,
 5  Blessing, praise and honor giving!

 1  Living for Jesus a life that is true,
 1  Striving to please Him in all that I do;
 1  Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,
 1  This is the pathway of blessing for me.
 
O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.
 
 2  Living for Jesus who died in my place,
 2  Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace;
 2  Such love constrains me to answer His call,
 2  Follow His leading and give Him my all.
 
O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.
 
 3  Living for Jesus wherever I am,
 3  Doing each duty in His holy name;
 3  Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
 3  Deeming each trial a part of my cross.
 
O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.
 
 4  Living for Jesus through earth's little while,
 4  My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
 4  Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
 4  Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
 
O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.

 1     Not to ourselves again,
 1     Not to flesh we live;
 1  Not to world henceforth shall we
 1     Our strength, our being give.
 
 2     The time past of our lives
 2     Sufficeth to have wrought
 2  The fleshly will, which only ill
 2     Hath to us ever brought.
 
 3     No longer is our life
 3     A thing unused or vain;
 3  To us e'en here to live is Christ,
 3     To us to die is gain.
 
 4     Our life is hid with Christ,
 4     With Christ in God above,
 4  Upward our heart would go to Him,
 4     Whom, seeing not, we love.
 
 5     He liveth, and we live!
 5     His life for us prevails;
 5  His fulness fills our mighty void,
 5     His strength for us avails.

 1  Jesus, I my cross have taken,

 1  Destitute, despised, forsaken,
 1     Thou, from hence, my all shalt be.
 1  Perish every fond ambition,

 1  Yet how rich is my condition,
 1     God and Christ are still my own!
 
 2  Let the world despise and leave me,
 2     They have left my Savior, too;
 2  Human hearts and looks deceive me;
 2     Thou art not, like man, untrue;
 2  And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
 2     God of wisdom, love, and might,
 2  Foes may hate, and friends disown me;
 2     Show Thy face, and all is bright.
 
 3  Man may trouble and distress me,

 3  Life with trials hard may press me,
 3     Christ will bring me sweeter rest.
 3  O 'tis not in grief to harm me,
 3     While Thy love is left to me;
 3  O 'twere not in joy to charm me,
 3     Were that joy unmixed with Thee.
 
 4  Haste thee on from grace to glory,
 4     Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
 4  God's eternal day's before thee,
 4     God's own hand shall guide thee there.
 4  Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
 4     Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
 4  Hope shall change to glad fruition,
 4     Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.

Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!

 2  Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,

Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!
 
 3  Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
 3  Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep;

Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!

 1  O Jesus, I have promised

 1  I shall not fear the battle

 2  Oh, let me feel Thee near me;

 2  But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
 2     And shield my soul from sin.
 
 3  Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,
 3     In accents clear and still,
 3  Above the storms of passion,
 3     The murmurs of self-will;
 3  Oh, speak to reassure me,
 3     To hasten, or control;
 3  Oh, speak, and make me listen,
 3     Thou Guardian of my soul.
 
 4  O Jesus, Thou hast promised
 4     To all who follow Thee
 4  That where Thou art in glory
 4     There shall Thy servant be;
 4  And, Jesus, I have promised

 4  Oh, give me grace to follow,

 5  Oh, let me see Thy footmarks,
 5     And in them plant mine own;
 5  My hope to follow duly
 5     Is in Thy strength alone.
 5  Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
 5     Uphold me to the end;
 5  And then to rest receive me,

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  This day the Lord has spoken,
 1     This day my choice is made:
 1  I will be all for Jesus,
 1     Who all for me has paid.
 
 2  Now His shall be the empire,
 2     In all things over me;
 2  And I will be His bond slave,
 2     Yet gloriously free.
 
 3  From henceforth, owning nothing,
 3     I cannot lose at all;
 3  I cannot well be poorer,
 3     Whatever may befall.
 
 4  Yet could I not be richer,
 4     If I the world should gain;
 4  For heav'n and earth shall perish,
 4     But Jesus will remain.
 
 5  And He will be my treasure,
 5     And He my boundless store;
 5  And those who live on Jesus,
 5     Will never hunger more.
 
 6  Though I am utter weakness,
 6     In Him I shall prevail;
 6  And though my love may falter,
 6     Yet His will never fail.

 1  Am I a soldier of the Cross -
 1     A follower of the Lamb?
 1  And shall I fear to own His cause,
 1     Or blush to speak His name?
 
In the name, the precious name,
   Of Him who died for me,
Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
   Whate'er my cross may be.
 
 2  Must I be carried to the skies
 2     On flowery beds of ease,
 2  While others fought to win the prize
 2     And sailed through bloody seas?
 
In the name, the precious name,
   Of Him who died for me,
Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
   Whate'er my cross may be.
 
 3  Are there no foes for me to face?
 3     Must I not stem the flood?
 3  Is this vile world a friend to grace,
 3     To help me on to God?
 
In the name, the precious name,
   Of Him who died for me,
Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
   Whate'er my cross may be.
 
 4  Since I must fight if I would reign,
 4     Increase my courage, Lord!
 4  I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
 4     Supported by Thy Word.
 
In the name, the precious name,
   Of Him who died for me,
Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
   Whate'er my cross may be.

 1  Who is on the Lord's side?
 1     Who will serve the King?
 1  Who will be His helpers,
 1     Other lives to bring?
 1  Who will leave the world's side?
 1     Who will face the foe?
 1  Who is on Lord's side?
 1     Who for Him will go?
 
By Thy grand redemption,
   By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
   Savior, we are Thine.
 
 2  Not for weight of glory,
 2     Not for crown and palm,
 2  Enter we the army,
 2     Raise the warrior psalm;
 2  But for love that claimeth
 2     Lives for whom He died;
 2  He whom Jesus nameth
 2     Must be on His side.
 
By Thy grand redemption,
   By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
   Savior, we are Thine.
 
 3  Jesus, Thou hast brought us,
 3     Not with gold or gem,
 3  But with Thine own life-blood,
 3     For Thy diadem;
 3  With Thy blessing filling
 3     Each who comes to Thee,
 3  Thou hast made us willing,
 3     Thou hast made us free.
 
By Thy grand redemption,
   By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
   Savior, we are Thine.
 
 4  Fierce may be the conflict,
 4     Strong may be the foe,
 4  But the King's own army
 4     None can overthrow.
 4  Round His standard ranging
 4     Victory is secure,
 4  For His truth unchanging
 4     Makes the triumph sure.
 
By Thy grand redemption,
   By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
   Savior, we are Thine.
 
 5  Chosen to be soldiers
 5     In an alien land:
 5  Chosen, called, and faithful,
 5     For our Captain's band;
 5  In the service royal
 5     Let us not grow cold;
 5  Let us be right loyal,
 5     Noble, true, and bold.
 
By Thy grand redemption,
   By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
   Savior, we are Thine.

 1  Praise by all to Thee be giv'n,

 2  All Thy counsel to fulfill.
 
 3  If so poor a worm as I,

 3  All my actions sanctify,
 3  All my words and thoughts receive;
 3  Claim me for Thy service, claim
 3  All I have, and all I am.
 
 4  Take my soul and body's powers,
 4  Take my mem'ry, mind, and will;
 4  All my goods and all my hours,
 4  All I know, and all I feel;
 4  All I think, or speak, or do;
 4  Take my heart, but make it new.
 
 5  Now, O God, Thine own I am,
 5  Now I give Thee back Thine own:
 5  Freedom, friends, and health, and fame,
 5  Consecrate to Thee alone;
 5  Thine I live, thrice happy I;
 5  Happier still when Thine I die.

 1  Many crowd the Savior's kingdom,
 1     Few receive His cross;
 1  Many seek His consolation,
 1     Few will suffer loss.
 1  For the dear sake of the Master,
 1     Counting all but dross,
 1  For the dear sake of the Master,
 1     Counting all but dross.
 
 2  Many sit at Jesus' table,
 2     Few will fast with Him,
 2  When the sorrow-cup of anguish
 2     Trembles to the brim.
 2  Few watch with Him in the garden,
 2     Who have sung the hymn,
 2  Few watch with Him in the garden,
 2     Who have sung the hymn.
 
 3  Many will confess His wisdom,
 3     Few embrace His shame.
 3  Many, should He smile upon them,
 3     Will His praise proclaim;
 3  Then, if for a while He leave them,
 3     They desert His name,
 3  Then, if for a while He leave them,
 3     They desert His name.
 
 4  But the souls who love Him truly,
 4     Let woe come or bliss,
 4  These will count their dearest heart's blood
 4     Not their own, but His.
 4  Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
 4     Give me love like this,
 4  Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
 4     Give me love like this.

 1  No mortal tongue can e'er describe
 1     The freedom of the soul,
 1  When passed beyond all earthly bribe
 1     To God's complete control.
 1  All things are his, yes, life, and death,
 1     Things present or to come;
 1  In Christ he draws in peace each breath,
 1     In Christ he finds his home.
 
 2  When such as we the King can choose,
 2     To share with Him His throne,
 2  'Tis passing strange that we refuse
 2     To be our Lord's alone.
 2  O never speak of sacrifice!
 2     A privilege untold
 2  Is to be His at any price,
 2     In Calv'ry's hosts enrolled.
 
 3  Arise! The holy bargain strike -
 3     The fragment for the whole -
 3  All men and all events alike
 3     Must serve the ransomed soul.
 3  All things are yours when you are His,
 3     And He and you are one;
 3  A boundless life in Him there is,
 3     Whence doubt and fear are gone.

 1  Though Christ a thousand times
 1  In Bethlehem be born,
 1  If He's not born in thee
 1  Thy soul is still forlorn.
 1  The Cross on Golgotha,
 1  Will never save thy soul;
 1  The Cross in thine own heart,
 1  Alone can make thee whole,
 
O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
   Into this heart of mine,
That I to my own self may die
   And rise to thy life Divine.
 
 2  What e'er thou lovest, man,
 2  That too become thou must;
 2  God, if thou lovest God,
 2  Dust, if thou lovest dust.
 2  Go out, God will come in;
 2  Die thou and let Him live;
 2  Be not and He will be;
 2  Wait and He'll all things give.
 
O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
   Into this heart of mine,
That I to my own self may die
   And rise to thy life Divine.
 
 3  To bring thee to thy God,
 3  Love takes the shortest route;
 3  The way which knowledge leads,
 3  Is but a roundabout.
 3  Drive out from thee the world,
 3  And then thy heart shall be
 3  Filled with the love of God,
 3  And holy like as He.
 
O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
   Into this heart of mine,
That I to my own self may die
   And rise to thy life Divine.

 1  Once I stood in condemnation,
 1     Waiting thus the sinner's doom;
 1  Christ in death has wrought salvation,
 1     God has raised Him from the tomb.
 1  Once I was to God a stranger,
 1     Filled with enmity and fear;
 1  He has rescued me from danger,
 1     Love revealed and brought me near.
 
 2  Now I see in Christ's acceptance
 2     But the measure of my own;
 2  He who lay beneath my sentence,
 2     Seated high upon the Throne.
 2  Quickened, raised, and in Him seated,
 2     I a full deliverance know;
 2  Every foe has been defeated,
 2     Every enemy laid low.
 
 3  Now I have a life in union
 3     With the risen Lord above;
 3  Now I drink in sweet communion
 3     Some rich foretaste of His love.
 3  Soon, O Lord! In highest glory,
 3     All its vastness I'll explore;
 3  Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
 3     While I worship and adore.

 1  Joined unto Christ the Conqueror,
 1     His Calv'ry triumph, too,
 1  Assures me in the darkest hour
 1     That He will take me through.
 
 2  Joined unto Christ the risen Lord,
 2     Triumphant now above;
 2  The glory of His cross reveals
 2     Magnificence of love.
 
 3  Joined unto Christ's full victory,
 3     Magnificently free;
 3  Declare it in the conquering name,
 3     And powers of darkness flee.
 
 4  Joined unto Christ! Magnificent!
 4     His wondrous Calvary plan,
 4  Draws us through ages to adore;
 4     For "Worthy is the Lamb."

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  Crucified with Christ my Savior,
 1  To the world and self and sin;
 1  To the death-born life of Jesus
 1  I am sweetly ent'ring in:
 1  In His fellowship of suff'ring,
 1  To His death conformed to be,
 1  I am going with my Savior
 1  All the way to Calvary.
 
All the way to Calvary,
Where my Savior went for me,
Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
All the way to Calvary.
 
 2  'Tis not hard to die with Christ
 2  When His risen life we know;
 2  'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings
 2  When our hearts with joy o'erflow.
 2  In His resurrection power
 2  He has come to dwell in me,
 2  And my heart is gladly going
 2  All the way to Calvary.
 
All the way to Calvary,
Where my Savior went for me,
Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
All the way to Calvary.
 
 3  If we die we'll live with Christ,
 3  If we suffer we shall reign;
 3  Only thus the prize of glory
 3  Can the conqueror attain.
 3  Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning
 3  Should the Master say to thee,
 3  "Yes, my child, thou didst go with me
 3  All the way to Calvary."
 
All the way to Calvary,
Where my Savior went for me,
Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
All the way to Calvary.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  I am crucified with Christ,
 1  And the cross hath set me free;
 1  I have ris'n again with Christ,
 1  And He lives and reigns in me.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.
 
 2  Mystery hid from ancient ages!
 2  But at length to faith made plain:
 2  Christ in me the Hope of Glory,
 2  Tell it o'er and o'er again.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.
 
 3  This the secret nature hideth,
 3  Harvest grows from buried grain;
 3  A poor tree with better grafted,
 3  Richer, sweeter life doth gain.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.
 
 4  This the secret of the holy,
 4  Not our holiness, but Him;
 4  O Lord! Empty us and fill us,
 4  With Thy fulness to the brim.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.
 
 5  This the balm for pain and sickness,
 5  Just to all our strength to die,
 5  And to find His life and fulness,
 5  All our being's need supply.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.
 
 6  This the story of the Master,
 6  Thru the Cross, He reached the Throne,
 6  And like Him our path to glory,
 6  Ever leads through death alone.
 
Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
To the world, and self, and sin;
Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
As He lives and reigns within.

 1  Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;
 1  What is there left for me to do?
 1  Simply to cease from struggling and strife,
 1  Simply to walk in newness of life.
 1        Glory be to God!
 
 2  Risen with Christ, my glorious Head,
 2  Holiness now the pathway I tread,
 2  Beautiful thought, while walking therein:
 2  He that is dead is freed from sin.
 2        Glory be to God!
 
 3  Living with Christ, who dieth no more,
 3  Following Christ, who goeth before;
 3  I am from bondage utterly freed,
 3  Reckoning self as dead indeed.
 3        Glory be to God!
 
 4  Living for Christ, my members I yield,
 4  Servants for God, for evermore sealed,
 4  Not under law, I'm now under grace,
 4  Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place.
 4        Glory be to God!
 
 5  Growing in Christ; no more shall be named
 5  Thing of which now I'm truly ashamed,
 5  Fruit unto holiness will I bear,
 5  Life evermore, the end I shall share.
 5        Glory be to God!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  When Christ once died on Calvary,
 1     I too was there;
 1  'Twas in my place He stood for me,
 1  And now accepted e'en as He,
 1     His name I bear.
 
I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
Who loved, and gave Himself for me.
 
 2  When Christ once rose with life divine,
 2     I too was there;
 2  His resurrection pow'r is mine,
 2  And as the branches and the vine
 2     His life I share.
 
I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
Who loved, and gave Himself for me.
 
 3  When Christ will come some day for me,
 3     I shall be there;
 3  With Him and like Him I shall be,
 3  And all His glorious majesty
 3     I too shall share.
 
I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
Who loved, and gave Himself for me.
 
 4  O blessed life so deep, so high,
 4     Lord, keep me there;
 4  Help me with Christ to live, to die,
 4  And let me with Him, bye and bye
 4     His glory share.
 
I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
Who loved, and gave Himself for me.

 1  What great provision God has made
 1     In Jesus' death on Calvary!
 1     I hung with Him upon the tree,
 1  And in His tomb I too was laid.
 
 2  I rose with Him from out the grave -
 2     And how shall I who died to sin
 2     Continue still to live therein,
 2  The victor living as the slave?
 
 3  At God's right hand He took His place,
 3     And while for saints my Savior pleads,
 3     My heart for sinners intercedes
 3  That they might know His saving grace.
 
 4  Oh, what a name to me is given -
 4     A son of God, by second birth!
 4     I represent Him on the earth,
 4  He represents me now in heaven.
 
 5  As Jesus dwells beyond the skies,
 5     I dwell within this world of strife;
 5     And as He lives within my life,
 5  In Him I'm in the heavenlies!

 1  Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
 1  Living with Jesus a new life divine;
 1  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
 1  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
 2  Never a battle with wrong for the right,
 2  Never a contest that He doth not fight;
 2  Lifting above us His banner so white;
 2  Moment by moment I'm kept in His sight.
 
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
 3  Never a trial that He is not there,
 3  Never a burden that He doth not bear;
 3  Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
 3  Moment by moment, I'm under His care.
 
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
 4  Never a heartache, and never a groan,
 4  Never a teardrop, and never a moan;
 4  Never a danger but there on the throne
 4  Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
 
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
 
 5  Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
 5  Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
 5  Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
 5  Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
 
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

What a wondrous fact, I'm crucified with Christ;
   Of my flesh and passion I'm relieved;
What a glorious fact, with Christ, the Lord, I live,
   Resurrected life in Him received.
 
On the Cross of Calvary the Lord and I
   Were crucified, were crucified;
Now in resurrection life with Him I live
   And in Him e'er abide.

 1  Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery,
 1  How on the Cross I died with Thee;
 1  I need no other pow'r or way
 1  That I may triumph day by day.
 
 2  That cross of Thine is also mine,
 2  Into my life its light doth shine;
 2  When I believe I'm dead with Thee,
 2  The world has lost it pow'r o'er me.
 
 3  Since I am crucified with Thee,
 3  From sin and self I am set free;
 3  How can I still enjoy the world
 3  Or seek its vanities unfurled?
 
 4  I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee
 4  Upon the cross of Calvary.
 4  Thy life and power then are mine,
 4  Since Thou and I in oneness twine.
 
 5  Since Thou didst come to slay the foe,
 5  His work and power to overthrow,
 5  I too can overcome in Thee
 5  And prove Thy mighty pow'r in me.
 
 6  Yet, for the vict'ry we rely
 6  Upon the death which Thou didst die;
 6  We tread the path which Thou hast trod
 6  Until we reach the goal in God.
 
 7  My death with Thee I now believe
 7  And all its meaning would receive.
 7  Thy death more deeply show to me,
 7  That from my flesh I may be free.
 
 8  I long to win as Thou hast won,
 8  To reign with Thee when Thou dost come.
 8  If we the cross will gladly bear,
 8  Then in Thy glory we will share.

 1  Oh, Jesus, Lord, when Thou on earth
 1  Accompanied Thy faithful band,
 1  It seemed they knew, but knew Thee not,
 1  Thyself they did not understand.
 
 2  They heard Thy voice, beheld Thy form,
 2  Thy beauteous stature unforgot;
 2  They crowded 'round Thee, met Thy gaze,
 2  But who Thou art, they knew it not.
 
 3  As they of old we too are veiled;
 3  We've known Thee long apparently;
 3  Yet if we say we know, at best
 3  We know Thee not transparently.
 
 4  But as the Spirit now Thou art,
 4  Another Comforter become;
 4  Reveal Thyself within my heart,
 4  Since to Thy temple Thou hast come.
 
 5  With Thy blest Spirit, Lord, fill me,
 5  Fill every corner of my soul;
 5  May Thou inspire my every part,
 5  Oh may Thou touch, renew the whole.
 
 6  The Spirit then revealing make
 6  Thyself more real within my heart,
 6  That ear not hear, nor eye may see
 6  How very real to me Thou art.
 
 7  When Thou in mercy dost reveal
 7  And give Thyself as Spirit thus,
 7  What in the world can be more real,
 7  More true than what Thou art to us?
 
 8  Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray,
 8  O'erflow my being as a flood,
 8  That every part with glory shine
 8  And everywhere be Thee and God.
 
 9  How close we are in such a life,
 9  In one is blended earth with heav'n;
 9  Thy presence sweetly fills our souls;
 9  Our hearts are to Thy praises giv'n.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Lord, when the Father ne'er was known,
 1  The Father came through Thee below,
 1  That we who lived in ignorance
 1  Might through Thyself the Father know.
 
 2  But, Lord, when Thou wast here on earth,
 2  How scarce were those Thyself who knew;
 2  A veil there was 'twixt Thee and them;
 2  They crowded 'round but saw not through.
 
 3  Now as the Spirit Thou hast come
 3  E'en as the Father came in Thee;
 3  As we through Thee the Father know,
 3  Now through the Spirit we know Thee.
 
 4  Not with the flesh Thou now art clothed -
 4  Then must Thou walk with toil around;
 4  But as the Spirit in our heart
 4  Thou dost supply Thyself unbound.
 
 5  Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called,
 5  But now the Holy Spirit art;
 5  The Spirit is Thine other form,
 5  Thyself to dwell within our heart.
 
 6  By knowing Thee as Spirit, Lord,
 6  We realize Thy life's outflow,
 6  Thy glory and Thy character,
 6  And all Thy being's wonders know.
 
 7  Praise to Thy Name now floods our heart;
 7  There is no one as dear as Thee;
 7  For since we know how real Thou art,
 7  No other one could lovelier be.

 1  Lord, Thou didst know when in the flesh,
 1  As such I'd know Thee shallowly;
 1  Then as the Spirit Thou didst come
 1  Within my spirit, known to be.
 
 2  In flesh Redeemer mine Thou art;
 2  As Spirit now my Comforter.
 2  The outward touch has passed away
 2  For inward union worthier.
 
 3  Because Thou art the Spirit now,
 3  Thyself revealing ceaselessly,
 3  Within my spirit I may know
 3  Thy presence and reality.
 
 4  I know Thy life surpassing far
 4  The knowledge Thy disciples had,
 4  Although they walked and lived with Thee,
 4  When Thou on earth in flesh wast clad.
 
 5  Because Thy Spirit dwells within,
 5  How real, O Lord, Thou art to me;
 5  Not touched, yet more reliable,
 5  Not seen, yet loved more fervently.
 
 6  Thy Holy Spirit deep within
 6  Supplies Thyself as righteousness,
 6  As holiness, redemption full,
 6  As wisdom and as fruitfulness.
 
 7  Thy Spirit in my spirit now
 7  Supplies Thyself, unites with me,
 7  Thus I am all the time myself
 7  And constantly am also Thee.

 1  In all Thy work, O Lord, Thou didst
 1  At Calv'ry's cross once come to rest;
 1  Yet Thou art working still today,
 1  But in another form expressed.
 
 2  Thy saving pow'r Thou still dost show;
 2  Thou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;
 2  Thou and the Spirit in one stream
 2  Sweep many in Thy living tide.
 
 3  Through Him Thy power's not withheld;
 3  Through Him Thy working does not cease;
 3  Thou still dost comfort and command,
 3  Encourage, strengthen, and release.
 
 4  Since Thou art with the Spirit one
 4  His coming means that Thou hast come,
 4  And His indwelling is Thine own,
 4  Since Thou the Spirit hast become.
 
 5  He executes within my heart
 5  All Thy desires and Thy demands,
 5  As for the Father here on earth
 5  Thou hast performed all His commands.
 
 6  By knowing Him we know Thyself;
 6  Obeying Him we Thee obey;
 6  Allowing Him ourselves to fill,
 6  We're filled with Thee, O wondrous way!
 
 7  Thou art not far away in heav'n,
 7  Leaving us here alone, apart;
 7  But Thou art still on earth; how grand!
 7  Thou livest right within my heart.

 3  And to Thine image true conforms
 3  And with Thy light illuminates.
 
 4  O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
 4  Who in my spirit makes His home;
 4  He mingles with my spirit too,
 4  And both one spirit thus become.
 
 5  Lord, teach me how to exercise
 5  My spirit now to contact Thee,
 5  That in Thy Spirit I may walk
 5  And live by Thy reality.

 1  Christ is the testimony true
 1  Of God in essence and in deed;
 1  God's glory He has fully shown,
 1  And we in Him God's nature read.
 
 2  His testimony is more full
 2  Than was the witness of the law,
 2  Which only God in letter showed,
 2  And not in endless living pow'r.
 
 3  The fulness of the Godhead dwells
 3  In Him, His very element;
 3  God's full embodiment is He -
 3  A vessel, God the resident.
 
 4  The Father God He manifests;
 4  God's glorious features He displays;
 4  In Him consummately are seen
 4  The Father's heart and all His ways.
 
 5  Christ as the Spirit now has come
 5  That He our portion be fore'er;
 5  In spirit we partake of Him
 5  And all God's being fully share.

 1  Christ is God's centrality
 1  And His universality;
 1  He is God's delight and joy
 1  Throughout all eternity.
 
 2  He's th' embodiment of God,
 2  In Him all God's fulness dwells;
 2  His unique supremacy
 2  And His Godhead none excels.
 
 3  All God's purpose is for Him,
 3  That He might be all in all;
 3  All the things in heav'n and earth
 3  With Himself are made withal.
 
 4  All creation is for Christ,
 4  Everything was made by Him;
 4  'Tis by Him all things subsist,
 4  He's the hub and He's the rim.
 
 5  In redemption He is all,
 5  All through Him is reconciled;
 5  By His blood all things with God
 5  Now in peace are domiciled.
 
 6  He the great beginning is,
 6  And the Church's living Head;
 6  He her life and content too,
 6  And the firstborn from the dead.
 
 7  In God's Kingdom He's the King,
 7  All the pow'r to Him is giv'n;
 7  In His glory He shall rule
 7  Over all in earth and heav'n.
 
 8  In new heaven and new earth
 8  Center of all things He'll be,
 8  For the Godhead and for man
 8  Throughout all eternity.
 
 9  God intends in everything
 9  Christ should have preeminence,
 9  And that such a Christ of all
 9  We should now experience.

 1  Christ is the one reality of all,
 1  Of Godhead and of man and all things else;
 1  No man without Him ever findeth God,
 1  Without Him man and everything is false.
 
 2  All types and figures of the ancient time,
 2  All things we ever need, both great and small,
 2  Only are shadows of the Christ of God,
 2  Showing that He must be our all in all.
 
 3  All things are vanity of vanities,
 3  Christ, the reality all things to fill;
 3  Though everything we may enjoy and own,
 3  If we're devoid of Christ we're empty still.
 
 4  Christ is our real God, our real Lord,
 4  Christ is our real life, our real light;
 4  Christ is our real food, our real drink,
 4  Our real clothing, and our real might.
 
 5  Christ also is the one reality
 5  Of all our doctrine and theology;
 5  And all our scriptural knowledge without Him
 5  Is just in letter and is vanity.
 
 6  Christ, the reality of time and space,
 6  Christ, the reality of every stage;
 6  Christ is the one reality of all
 6  Thru all eternity from age to age.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Grace in its highest definition is
 1  God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
 1  It is not only something done or giv'n,
 1  But God Himself, our portion glorious.
 
 2  God is incarnate in the flesh that we
 2  Him may receive, experience ourself;
 2  This is the grace which we receive of God,
 2  Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.
 
 3  Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,
 3  'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;
 3  'Tis by this grace - the Lord experienced -
 3  That he surpassed the others in the race.
 
 4  It is this grace - Christ as our inward strength -
 4  Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;
 4  It is this grace which in our spirit is,
 4  There energizing, working out God's will.
 
 5  This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,
 5  Is what we need and must experience;
 5  Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,
 5  Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.

Christ in me, Christ in me,

 1  O glorious Christ, Savior mine,
 1  Thou art truly radiance divine;
 1  God infinite, in eternity,
 1  Yet man in time, finite to be.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 2  The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
 2  Thou dost manifest God's glory;
 2  In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
 2  As Spirit, oneness with me sought.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 3  All things of the Father are Thine;
 3  All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
 3  The Spirit makes Thee real to me,
 3  That Thou experienced might be.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 4  The Spirit of life causes Thee
 4  By Thy Word to transfer to me.
 4  Thy Spirit touched, Thy Word received,
 4  Thy life in me is thus conceived.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 5  In spirit while gazing on Thee,
 5  As a glass reflecting Thy glory,
 5  Like to Thyself transformed I'll be,
 5  That Thou might be expressed thru me.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 6  In no other way could we be
 6  Sanctified and share Thy vict'ry;
 6  Thus only spiritual we'll be,
 6  And touch the life of glory.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.
 
 7  Thy Spirit will me saturate,
 7  Every part will God permeate,
 7  Deliv'ring me from the old man,
 7  With all saints building for His plan.
 
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.

He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
You ask me how I know He lives?

Christ liveth in me,
Christ liveth in me;
Oh! what a salvation this,
That Christ liveth in me.
 
 3  As lives the flow'r within the seed,
 3     As in the cone the tree,
 3  So, praise the Christ of truth and grace,
 3     His Spirit dwelleth in me.
 
Christ liveth in me,
Christ liveth in me;
Oh! what a salvation this,
That Christ liveth in me.
 
 4  With longing all my heart is filled,
 4     That like Him I may be,
 4  As on the wondrous thought I dwell
 4     That Christ liveth in me.
 
Christ liveth in me,
Christ liveth in me;
Oh! what a salvation this,
That Christ liveth in me.

 1  Made free! Made free! O captive!
 1     Bound by the law of sin,
 1  The law of life in Spirit
 1     Will quicken you within.
 1  And counting on the Spirit,
 1     His life shall now control
 1  The members of your body,
 1     The portals of your soul.
 
 2  Made free! Made free in Jesus:
 2     For crucified with Him,
 2  From center to circumf'rence,
 2     He breaks the power of sin.
 2  No longer act in body
 2     As if it had no "law";
 2  His "law of life" must govern
 2     All that ran wild before.
 
 3  Made free! Made free in Jesus:
 3     Deep planted in His death,
 3  He liberates His life pow'r,
 3     And breathes His Spirit's breath.
 3  Then waxing strong in spirit,
 3     With force of quickening life;
 3  The soul and body governed,
 3     Its members cease from strife!
 
 4  Made free! Made free in Jesus:
 4     Joined to the Risen One,
 4  By conflict prayer you triumph,
 4     And claim His victory won.
 4  Freed with His glorious freedom,
 4     Above the darkness rife;
 4  For now the law of sin and death
 4     Is conquered by His life.

 1  A flowing river and a tree,
 1  Eden's outstanding features are,
 1  Man to supply with food and drink
 1     That he may live fore'er.
 
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
   Filled with His life I'll be.
 
 2  The tree the glorious Christ does show,
 2  As living food to man supplied,
 2  That he God's riches may enjoy,
 2     Thus to be satisfied.
 
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
   Filled with His life I'll be.
 
 3  The river does the Spirit show,
 3  Coming man's spirit to supply,
 3  That with God's riches he be filled,
 3     Holy to be thereby.
 
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
   Filled with His life I'll be.
 
 4  The Christ of glory is my life,
 4  He as the Spirit lives in mine,
 4  That I with God be fully blent
 4     And in His image shine.
 
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
   Filled with His life I'll be.
 
 5  I would exalt this glorious Christ,
 5  Ever the Spirit I'd obey,
 5  Making His glory fully known,
 5     Filled with His grace for aye.
 
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
   Filled with His life I'll be.

 1  I've found the One of peerless worth,
 1     My heart doth sing for joy;
 1  And sing I must, for Christ I have:
 1     Oh, what a Christ have I!
 
 2  My Christ, He is the Lamb of God,
 2     Who full salvation brings;
 2  He is the Sun of Righteousness,
 2     With healing in His wings.
 
 3  My Christ, He is the Tree of Life
 3     With fruit abundant, sweet;
 3  My hunger He doth satisfy;
 3     Of Him I daily eat.
 
 4  My Christ, He is the smitten Rock
 4     Whence living waters burst;
 4  He is the fountain in my heart
 4     Which quenches all my thirst.
 
 5  Christ is my life, my light my way,
 5     My comfort and my health,
 5  My peace, my rest, my joy, my hope,
 5     My glory and my wealth.
 
 6  Christ is my wisdom and my pow'r,

 8  Christ is my Captain and my Guard,
 8     My Teacher and my Guide,
 8  My Bridegroom, Master and my Head;
 8     In me doth He reside.
 
 9  Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
 9     My Prophet full of sight;
 9  My Priest that stands 'twixt me and God,
 9     My King that rules with might.
 
 10  Christ is the Author of my faith,
 10     And its Perfecter too,
 10  My Mediator, Guarantee,
 10     And faithful Witness true.
 
 11  Christ is my everlasting home,
 11     My all-sufficient land;
 11  My fortress, tower, hiding-place,
 11     And my eternal stand.
 
 12  Christ is my sabbath and new moon,
 12     My morning and my day,
 12  My age and my eternity
 12     That ne'er will pass away.
 
 13  Christ is my trust and my desire,
 13     In comeliness replete,
 13  My satisfaction and delight,
 13     Who all my need doth meet.
 
 14  My Christ, the all-inclusive One,
 14     My Christ what shall I call?
 14  He is the first, He is the last,
 14     My Christ is All in all.
 
 15  Since such a treasure I possess,
 15     My heart doth sing for joy;
 15  And I must sing, and sing again;
 15     Oh, what a Christ have I!

 1  Once it was the blessing,
 1     Now it is the Lord;
 1  Once it was the feeling,
 1     Now it is His Word;
 1  Once His gift I wanted,
 1     Now, the Giver own;
 1  Once I sought for healing,
 1     Now Himself alone.
 
All in all forever,
   Only Christ I'll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
   And Christ is everything.
 
 2  Once 'twas painful trying,
 2     Now 'tis perfect trust;
 2  Once a half salvation,
 2     Now the uttermost;
 2  Once 'twas ceaseless holding,
 2     Now He holds me fast;
 2  Once 'twas constant drifting,
 2     Now my anchor's cast.
 
All in all forever,
   Only Christ I'll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
   And Christ is everything.
 
 3  Once 'twas busy planning,
 3     Now 'tis trustful prayer;
 3  Once 'twas anxious caring,
 3     Now He has the care;
 3  Once 'twas what I wanted,
 3     Now what Jesus says;
 3  Once 'twas constant asking,
 3     Now 'tis ceaseless praise.
 
All in all forever,
   Only Christ I'll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
   And Christ is everything.
 
 4  Once it was my working,
 4     His it hence shall be;
 4  Once I tried to use Him,
 4     Now He uses me;
 4  Once the pow'r I wanted,
 4     Now the Mighty One;
 4  Once for self I labored,
 4     Now for Him alone.
 
All in all forever,
   Only Christ I'll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
   And Christ is everything.
 
 5  Once I hoped in Jesus,
 5     Now I know He's mine;
 5  Once my lamps were dying,
 5     Now they brightly shine;
 5  Once for death I waited,
 5     Now His coming hail;
 5  And my hopes are anchored
 5     Safe within the veil.
 
All in all forever,
   Only Christ I'll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
   And Christ is everything.

 1  There is One amid all changes
 1     Who standeth ever fast,

Jesus is the last,
Trust Him for thy future,

 1  All is in Christ;
 1     God's dear Son is Lord of all.
 1  Jesus Christ is life's perfection,
 1     Perfect love and perfect light.
 1  Son of God, the true reflection
 1     Of the Father's radiance bright.
 1  All the treasures of God's riches,
 1     All the secrets of His wisdom,
 1  All in Christ are hid away.
 1     Let His name be praised today!
 
 2  All is in Christ;
 2     God's dear Son is Lord of all.
 2  Blessings are imparted to us
 2     By the shameful cross He bore.
 2  By His suffering inglorious
 2     We have peace forevermore.
 2  By the Cross we have forgiveness,
 2     Life eternal, endless mercy.
 2  By God's Son is freely giv'n
 2     Everything in earth and heav'n.
 
 3  All is in Christ;
 3     God's dear Son is Lord of all.
 3  In me there is naught but weakness,
 3     I am worthless, full of sin,
 3  Stricken by its mortal sickness,
 3     Lacking light and hope within.
 3  Now in Christ I find abundant
 3     Victory and strength and power.
 3  Savior, come and live in me,
 3     Come and make me rich in Thee.
 
 4  All is in Christ;
 4     God's dear Son is Lord of all.
 4  Savior, pardon my transgressions,
 4     For my love is still so small;
 4  Though I gave all my possessions,
 4     This would profit scarce at all.
 4  'Tis myself that Thou desirest;
 4     So I give myself, dear Master;
 4  No thing hast Thou kept from me -
 4     Nor will I keep aught from Thee.
 
 5  All is in Christ;
 5     Your whole self present to Him.
 5  Vain your quest for lasting pleasure,
 5     Wealth, success, and worldly fame;
 5  Christ alone must be your treasure,
 5     His resource your only claim.
 5  Come, let Him disperse the famine
 5     Of your arid, waste existence.
 5  Let God's Son, th' Immortal King
 5     Freely give you everything.

 5  One holy light, one heavenly flame.

 1  And reconciled my soul to God:
 1     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 
 2  I envy not the rich their joys:
 2     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 2  I covet not earth's glitt'ring toys:
 2     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 2  Earth can no lasting bliss bestow,
 2     "Fading" is stamped on all below;
 2  Mine is a joy no end can know:
 2     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 
 3  Though with the poor be cast my lot:
 3     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 3  "He knoweth best," I murmur not:
 3     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 3  Though "vine" and "fig-tree" blight assail,
 3     The "labor of the olive fail,"
 3  And death o'er flock and herd prevail,
 3     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 
 4  Though I am now on hostile ground,
 4     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 4  And sin beset me all around,
 4     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 4  Let earth her fiercest battles wage,
 4     And foes against my soul engage,
 4  Strong in His strength I scorn their rage:
 4     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 
 5  And when my life draws to its close,
 5     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 5  Safe in His arms I shall repose,
 5     Christ for me! Christ for me!
 5  When sharpest pains my frame pervade,
 5     And all the powers of nature fade,
 5  Still will I sing through death's cold shade;
 5     Christ for me! Christ for me!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  My heart is fixed, eternal God,
 1     Fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee;
 1  And my immortal choice is made,
 1     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 1  He is my prophet, priest, and king,
 1  Who did for me salvation bring,
 1  And while I've breath I mean to sing,
 1     Christ for me, Christ for me.
 
 2  In Him I see the Godhead shine,
 2     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 2  He is the majesty divine,
 2     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 2  The Father's well-beloved Son,
 2  Co-partner of His royal throne,
 2  Who bore the guilt of man alone,
 2     Christ for me, Christ for me.
 
 3  Let others boast of heaps of gold,
 3     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 3  His riches never can be told,
 3     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 3  Your gold will waste and wear away,
 3  Your honors perish in a day;
 3  My portion never can decay,
 3     Christ for me, Christ for me.
 
 4  In pining sickness, or in health,
 4     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 4  In deepest poverty or wealth,
 4     Christ for me, Christ for me;
 4  And in that all-important day,
 4  When I the summons must obey,
 4  And pass from this dark world away,
 4     Christ for me, Christ for me.

 1  I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,
 1     And I begin to see,
 1  What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
 1     What they may be to Thee;
 1  If only they will yield Thee all,
 1  And trustingly obey Thy call.
 
 2  How wonderful! I never knew
 2     That I might trust Thee so;
 2  That Thou wouldst be so much to me,
 2     In all the way I go,
 2  That every need Thou wouldst supply,
 2  And all my longings satisfy.
 
 3  I take Thee as my keeper now,
 3     And I commit to Thee
 3  My soul, my way, my works, my cause,
 3     In Thy sole charge to be;
 3  And my deposit, Thou, I know
 3  Wilt guard secure from every foe.
 
 4  I take Thee for my peace, O Lord,
 4     My heart to keep and fill,
 4  Thine own great calm, amid earth's storms
 4     Shall keep me always still;
 4  And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
 4  So shall Thine ever-deep'ning peace.
 
 5  I take Thee as my wisdom too,
 5     For wisdom's sum Thou art;
 5  Thou, who dost choose the foolish things,
 5     Set me henceforth apart,
 5  That I may speak and work for Thee
 5  As Thou shalt work and speak in me.
 
 6  I take Thee, Lord, to be my all,
 6     Since all Thou art is mine;
 6  I nothing have, and nothing am;
 6     That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
 6  Thou shalt be everything to me,
 6  In all things my sufficiency.

 1  O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
 1     And found in Thee alone,
 1  The peace, the joy I sought so long,
 1     The bliss till now unknown.
 
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
   None other name for me;
There's love and life and lasting joy,
   Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
 
 2  I sighed for rest and happiness,
 2     I yearned for them, not Thee;
 2  But, while I passed my Savior by,
 2     His love laid hold on me.
 
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
   None other name for me;
There's love and life and lasting joy,
   Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
 
 3  I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
 3     But, ah, the waters failed!
 3  E'en as I stooped to drink they fled,
 3     And mocked me as I wailed.
 
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
   None other name for me;
There's love and life and lasting joy,
   Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
 
 4  The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
 4     But never wept for Thee,
 4  Till grace the sightless eyes received,
 4     Thy loveliness to see.
 
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
   None other name for me;
There's love and life and lasting joy,
   Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  I have come to the Fountain of Life,
 1  A fountain that flows from above;
 1  I have passed from the waters of strife
 1  And come to the Elim of love;
 1  I have drunk of the heavenly well,
 1  In the depths of my being it springs.
 1  No mortal can measure or tell
 1  The gladness the Comforter brings.
 
Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
The fountain that never runs dry;
Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
For Christ is the Fountain of Life.
 
 2  I have come to the Fountain of Blood
 2  That for guilt and uncleanness doth flow;
 2  I have washed in its sin-cleansing flood
 2  And my garments are whiter than snow.
 2  I count not my righteousness mine -
 2  'Tis Jesus that lives in my soul.
 2  I partake of His nature divine,
 2  And in Him I am perfectly whole.
 
Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
The fountain that never runs dry;
Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
For Christ is the Fountain of Life.
 
 3  I have come to the Fountain of Health,
 3  A boundless and endless supply;
 3  'Tis a secret man's wisdom and wealth
 3  Can never discover or buy.
 3  But the secret my Lord hath revealed
 3  In the fountain that flows from His side,
 3  In the stripes by whose pain we are healed,
 3  In Himself as He comes to abide.
 
Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
The fountain that never runs dry;
Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
For Christ is the Fountain of Life.
 
 4  I have come to the Fountain of Joy;
 4  His joy is the strength of my heart.
 4  My delight is unmixed with alloy,
 4  My sunshine can never depart.
 4  The fig tree may wither and die,
 4  Earth's pleasures and prospects decline;
 4  But my fountains can never be dry -
 4  My portion, my joy is divine.
 
Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
The fountain that never runs dry;
Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
For Christ is the Fountain of Life.

 1  I have found, I have found the way
 1     Which leads to heav'nly rest;
 1  I have found, I have found the peace
 1     Which filled my Savior's breast.
 1  O friends in the desert past,
 1     Come, join in prayer and praise;
 1  E'en now He waits our cry,
 1     The Savior who saves always.
 
 2  He hath taken our sins away,
 2     When on Calv'ry's cross He bled;
 2  The disease of our soul He heals
 2     By His Spirit freely shed;
 2  Though Satan hath pierced us deep,
 2     And great the grace each prays;
 2  The more we prove His might,
 2     The Savior who saves always.
 
 3  Long, alas! in the gloom I fought,
 3     'Mid strife of wind and waves;
 3  Jesus seemed only this to me:
 3     A Savior who sometimes saves.
 3  But sweet are the light and calm
 3     That fill my happy days,
 3  Since now I fully trust
 3     The Savior who saves always.
 
 4  O my Sun and my Shield art Thou!
 4     Lead on where Thou hast trod;
 4  My Salvation, my Joy, my Song,
 4     My Brother, and yet my God.
 4  Whate'er then my life betide,
 4     I now can trust and praise;
 4  Each moment Thou wilt save,
 4     O Savior, who sav'st always.

 1  Jesus, Fountain of my days,
 1     Well-spring of my heart's delight,
 1  Brightness of my morning rays,
 1     Solace of my hours of night;
 1  When I see Thee, I arise
 1  To the hope of cloudless skies.
 
 2  Oh, how weary were the years
 2     Ere Thy form to me was known;
 2  Oh, how gloomy were the fears
 2     When I seemed to be alone;
 2  I despaired the storm to brave
 2  Till Thy footprints touched the wave.
 
 3  But Thy presence on the deep
 3     Calmed the pulses of the sea,
 3  And the waters sank to sleep
 3     In the rest of seeing Thee;
 3  And my once rebellious will
 3  Heard the mandate, Peace, be still!
 
 4  Now Thy will and mine are one,
 4     Heart in heart, and hand in hand;
 4  All the clouds have touched the sun,
 4     And the ships have reached the land;
 4  For Thy love has said to me,
 4  No more night! and No more sea!

 1  How tedious and tasteless the hours
 1  When Jesus no longer I see!
 1  Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow'rs,
 1  Have all lost their sweetness to me.
 1  The midsummer sun shines but dim,
 1  The fields strive in vain to look gay;
 1  But when I am happy in Him
 1  December's as pleasant as May.
 
 2  His name yields the richest perfume,
 2  And sweeter than music His voice;
 2  His presence disperses my gloom,
 2  And makes all within me rejoice.
 2  I should, were He always thus nigh,
 2  Have nothing to wish or to fear;
 2  No mortal so happy as I;
 2  My summer would last all the year.
 
 3  Content with beholding His face,
 3  My all to His pleasure resigned;
 3  No changes of season or place,
 3  Would make any change in my mind.
 3  While blessed with a sense of His love,
 3  A palace a toy would appear;
 3  And prisons would palaces prove,
 3  If Jesus would dwell with me there.
 
 4  My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
 4  If Thou art my sun and my song,
 4  Say, why do I languish and pine?
 4  And why are my winters so long?
 4  Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,
 4  Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
 4  Or take me to Thee up on high,
 4  Where winter and clouds are no more.

 1  Jesus is all the world to me:

 3     He's my Friend.
 
 4  Jesus is all the world to me,
 4     I want no better friend.
 4  I trust Him now; I'll trust Him when
 4     Life's fleeting days shall end.
 4  Beautiful life with such a Friend;
 4  Beautiful life that has no end!
 4  Eternal life, eternal joy,
 4     He's my Friend.

 1  Thou hidden source of calm repose,
 1  Thou all-sufficient love divine;
 1  My help and refuge from my foes,
 1  Secure I am, if Thou art mine;
 1  From sin and grief, from guilt and shame,
 1  I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.
 
 2  Jesus, my All in all Thou art,
 2  My rest in toil, mine ease in pain;
 2  The med'cine of my broken heart;
 2  In war, my peace; in loss, my gain;
 2  My smile beneath the tyrant's frown;
 2  In shame, my glory and my crown.
 
 3  In want, my plentiful supply;
 3  In weakness, mine almighty power;
 3  In bonds, my perfect liberty;
 3  My light in Satan's darkest hour;
 3  In grief, my joy unspeakable;
 3  My life in death; my Lord, my all.

 1  The Savior can lift every burden,
 1     The heavy as well as the light;
 1  His strength is made perfect in weakness,
 1     In Him there is power and might.
 
The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
There is nothing that He cannot do.
 
 2  The Savior can bear every sorrow,
 2     In Him there is comfort and rest;
 2  No matter how great the affliction,
 2     He only permits what is best.
 
The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
There is nothing that He cannot do.
 
 3  The Savior can strengthen the weary,
 3     His grace is sufficient for all;
 3  He knows every step of the pathway
 3     And listens to hear when we call.
 
The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
There is nothing that He cannot do.
 
 4  The Savior can break sin's dominion,
 4     The vict'ry He won long ago;
 4  In Him there is freedom from bondage,
 4     He's able to conquer the foe.
 
The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
There is nothing that He cannot do.
 
 5  The Savior can satisfy fully
 5     The heart that the world cannot fill;
 5  His Spirit will sanctify wholly
 5     The soul that is yielded and still.
 
The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
There is nothing that He cannot do.

 1  All things are possible to him

 1  I can, I do believe in Thee;

 2  'Twas most impossible of all
 2  That here sin's reign in me should cease;

 2  If nothing is too hard for Thee,
 2  All things are possible to me.
 
 3  Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,

 5  Let me no longer live, but Thee;
 5  Give me this hour in Thee to prove
 5  The sweet omnipotence of love.

 1  Objective and subjective Christ is to us,
 1  In heaven He's pleading objectively thus;
 1  Subjectively now in His members He lives
 1  And inwardly to them His being He gives.
 
 2  In heaven He sits at the right hand of God,
 2  Where as the High Priest He presented His blood;
 2  Our Advocate, bearing our burdens above,
 2  Our Surety, He careth for us in His love.
 
 3  He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;
 3  He's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;
 3  He's there as our strength and our grace every hour,
 3  Our Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.
 
 4  In heaven for us He's the glorified man,
 4  The Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;
 4  Man into God bringing and making him one
 4  With God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.
 
 5  In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;
 5  As Spirit He brings God Himself thus within,
 5  Revealing and making God real unto us,
 5  God one with us building in life glorious.
 
 6  The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells,
 6  And soon He's returning for us His Word tells;
 6  Deliverer indwelling, He now in us lives,
 6  And soon will transfigure, His glory to give.
 
 7  The day soon is coming when heaven and earth
 7  Will mingle in one in that city of worth;
 7  Objective and subjective will in that day
 7  Be mingled within us in glory for aye.

 1  What release the Savior gave me!
 1     Christ indeed has set me free!
 1  All the pow'r of sin is broken,
 1     All death's sting is passed from me!
 
Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
   By His mighty victory,
Now His resurrection power

 2  From the law Christ has delivered,

 2  Nevermore the law shall bind me,
 2     But by grace I'll live instead.
 
Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
   By His mighty victory,
Now His resurrection power
   From my spirit strengthens me!
 
 3  Christ has sin condemned at Calv'ry
 3     And its power done away;
 3  Now it has no ground within me,
 3     I am freed from all its sway.
 
Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,

Now His resurrection power

Now His resurrection power
   From my spirit strengthens me!
 
 5  Christ through death has crushed the devil,
 5     World and demons by His might,
 5  From the pow'r of darkness brought me
 5     To the realm of life and light.
 
Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
   By His mighty victory,
Now His resurrection power
   From my spirit strengthens me!
 
 6  All-sufficient grace He giveth,
 6     With His pow'r He covers me,
 6  Makes me glory in my weakness
 6     And in weakness strengthens me.
 
Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
   By His mighty victory,
Now His resurrection power
   From my spirit strengthens me!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Not the law of letters,
 1  But the Christ of life
 1  God desires to give us,
 1  Saving us from strife;
 1  It is not some doctrine,
 1  But 'tis Christ Himself
 1  Who alone releases
 1  From our sinful self.
 
 2  Any kind of teaching,
 2  Any kind of form,
 2  Cannot quicken spirits
 2  Or our souls transform;
 2  It is Christ as Spirit
 2  Gives us life divine,
 2  Thus thru us to live the
 2  Life of God's design.
 
 3  Not philosophy nor
 3  Any element
 3  Can to Christ conform us
 3  As His complement;
 3  But 'tis Christ Himself who
 3  All our nature takes
 3  And in resurrection
 3  Us His members makes.
 
 4  Not religion, even
 4  Christianity,
 4  Can fulfill God's purpose
 4  Or economy;
 4  But 'tis Christ within us
 4  As our all in all
 4  Satisfies God's wishes,
 4  And His plan withal.
 
 5  All the gifts we're given
 5  By the Lord in grace,
 5  All the different functions
 5  Cannot Christ replace.
 5  Only Christ Himself must
 5  Be our all in all!
 5  Only Christ Himself in
 5  All things, great or small!

 7     Repose that knows no shock,
 7  The strength of love that keeps it blest
 7     In Thee, the riven Rock.
 
 8  My heart, as girt around,
 8     Her citadel hath found;
 8  I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
 8     O Jesus most desired.

 1  Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
 1  For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;
 1  My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou,
 1  If ever I love Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.
 
 2  I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,
 2  And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
 2  I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow,
 2  If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.
 
 3  I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
 3  And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
 3  And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,
 3  If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.
 
 4  In ages eternal of endless delight
 4  I'll ever adore Thee in glory so bright;
 4  I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
 4  If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.

 1  When this passing world is done,
 1  When has sunk yon glaring sun,
 1  When we stand with Christ on high,
 1  Looking o'er life's history;
 1  Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
 1  Not till then, how much I owe.
 
 2  When I stand before the throne
 2  Dressed in beauty not my own,
 2  When I see Thee as Thou art,
 2  Love Thee with unsinning heart;
 2  Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
 2  Not till then, how much I owe.
 
 3  E'en on earth, as through a glass
 3  Darkly, let Thy glory pass;
 3  Make forgiveness feel so sweet;
 3  Make Thy Spirit's help so meet:
 3  E'en on earth, Lord, make me know
 3  Something of how much I owe.

 1  Something every heart is loving:
 1     If not Jesus, none can rest;
 1  Lord, my heart to Thee is given;
 1     Take it, for it loves Thee best.
 
 2  Thus I cast the world behind me;
 2     Jesus most beloved shall be;
 2  Beauteous more than all things beauteous,
 2     He alone is joy to me.
 
 3  Bright with all eternal radiance
 3     Is the glory of Thy face;
 3  Thou art loving, sweet, and tender,
 3     Full of pity, full of grace.
 
 4  When I hated, Thou didst love me,
 4     Shedd'st for me Thy precious blood;
 4  Still Thou lovest, lovest ever,
 4     Shall I not love Thee, my God?
 
 5  Keep my heart still faithful to Thee,
 5     That my earthly life may be
 5  But a shadow to that glory
 5     Of my hidden life in Thee.

 5  I transparent have to be

 1  Enter the veil and go without the camp,

 1  If by the Holiest I am satisfied,
 1  How can I of earth's vanities partake?
 
 2  Enter the veil and go without the camp,
 2  By heaven's presence will the earth depart;
 2  If heaven's glory doth my spirit charm,
 2  How can earth's happiness possess my heart?
 
 3  Enter the veil, behold the glorious Christ,
 3  Go out the camp to Jesus, let Him lead;
 3  If throne and crown my spirit here enthrall,
 3  Manger and cross cannot my steps impede.
 
 4  Enter the veil for resurrection pow'r,
 4  Go out the camp to bear the cross and woe,
 4  If I His radiant face in heaven see,
 4  His footsteps I will follow here below.
 
 5  Enter the veil, on heaven's fatness feast,
 5  Without the camp, in hardship persevere;
 5  Though earthly trials sorely pain my heart,
 5  Heaven's communion doth my spirit cheer.
 
 6  Enter the veil, Christ's riches there enjoy,
 6  Without the camp, the needs of men supply;
 6  The life of heaven living out thru me
 6  The souls of earth will bless and satisfy.
 
 7  Enter the veil till it exists no more,
 7  Go out the camp till all the camps are gone;
 7  Until the heavens and the earth unite,
 7  Till God and man together dwell in one.

 1  Through Thy precious body broken -
 1        Inside the veil;
 1  Oh! what words to sinners spoken -
 1        Inside the veil.
 1  Precious as the blood that brought us;
 1  Perfect, as the love that sought us;
 1  Holy, as the Lamb that brought us -
 1        Inside the veil.
 
 2  When we see Thy love unshaken -
 2        Outside the camp.
 2  Scorned by man, by God forsaken -
 2        Outside the camp.
 2  Thy loved cross alone can charm us;
 2  Shame need now no more alarm us;
 2  Glad we follow, nought can harm us -
 2        Outside the camp.
 
 3  Lamb of God, through Thee we enter -
 3        Inside the veil.
 3  Cleansed by Thee, we boldly venture -
 3        Inside the veil.
 3  Not a stain; a new creation:
 3  Ours is such a full salvation;
 3  Low we bow in adoration -
 3        Inside the veil.
 
 4  Unto Thee, the homeless stranger -
 4        Outside the camp,
 4  Forth we hasten, fear no danger -
 4        Outside the camp.
 4  Thy reproach, far richer treasure
 4  Than all Egypt's boasted pleasure;
 4  Drawn by love that knows no measure -
 4        Outside the camp.
 
 5  Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered -
 5        Inside the veil.
 5  All with Thee - no more be scattered -
 5        Inside the veil.
 5  Nought from Thee, our hearts shall sever;
 5  We shall see Thee; grieve Thee never;
 5  "Praise the Lamb!" shall sound forever -
 5        Inside the veil.

I am living in the presence of the King.

 1  Marvel not that Christ in glory
 1     All my inmost heart hath won;
 1  Not a star to cheer my darkness,
 1     But a light beyond the sun,
 1  All below lies dark and shadowed,
 1     Nothing here to claim my heart,
 1  Save the lonely track of sorrow
 1     Where of old He walked apart.
 
 2  Others in the earthly sunshine
 2     Wearily may journey on,
 2  I have seen a light from heaven
 2     Past the brightness of the sun -
 2  Light that knows no cloud, no waning,
 2     Light wherein I see His face,
 2  All His love's uncounted treasures,
 2     All the riches of His grace:
 
 3  All the wonders of His glory,
 3     Deeper wonders of His love -
 3  How for me He won, He keepeth
 3     That high standing all above;
 3  Not a glimpse - the veil uplifted -
 3     But within the veil to dwell,
 3  Gazing on His face forever,
 3     Hearing words unspeakable.
 
 4  I have seen the face of Jesus -
 4     Tell me not of aught beside;
 4  I have heard the voice of Jesus -
 4     All my soul is satisfied.
 4  In the radiance of the glory
 4     First I saw His blessed face,
 4  And forever shall that glory
 4     Be my home, my dwelling-place.

 1  In the secret of His presence
 1     How my soul delights to hide!
 1  Oh, how precious are the lessons
 1     Which I learn at Jesus' side!
 1  Earthly cares can never vex me,
 1     Neither trials lay me low;
 1  For when Satan comes to tempt me,
 1     To the secret place I go.
 
 2  When my soul is faint and thirsty,
 2     'Neath the shadow of His wing
 2  There is cool and pleasant shelter,
 2     And a fresh and crystal spring;
 2  And my Savior rests beside me,
 2     As we hold communion sweet;
 2  If I tried, I could not utter
 2     What He says when thus we meet.
 
 3  Only this I know: I tell Him
 3     All my doubts and griefs and fears;
 3  Oh, how patiently He listens!
 3     And my drooping soul He cheers;
 3  Do you think He ne'er reproves me?
 3     What a false friend He would be,
 3  If He never, never told me
 3     Of the sins which He must see.
 
 4  Would you like to know that sweetness
 4     Of the secret of the Lord?
 4  Go and hide beneath the shadow;
 4     This shall then be your reward;
 4  And whene'er you leave the silence
 4     Of that happy meeting-place,
 4  By the Spirit bear the image
 4     Of the Master in your face.

 1  Thy name is sweet as ointment poured forth;
 1  Better Thy love than wine, O draw Thou me!
 1  If we the footsteps follow of the flock,
 1  Entered Thy fellowship of love we'll be.
 
 2  He's my Beloved, I am His own love;
 2  He draweth me, pursue I after Him.
 2  Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;
 2  Beauteous as henna*, I'd be clothed with Him;
 
 3  Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,
 3  Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;
 3  His love the banner, His affection shown
 3  Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.
 
 4  Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;
 4  I am a lily and my Shepherd He;
 4  May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,
 4  Him on the mountains as a hart I'd see.
 
 5  Myrrh of the death with Him and frankincense,
 5  The resurrection, permeate my heart;
 5  North wind awake, and let the south wind blow,
 5  Make my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.
 
 6  I'd be to Him a dove that's undefiled,
 6  As a pure lily in His presence be,
 6  His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,
 6  He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.
 
 7  Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I'd be,
 7  Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;
 7  For my Beloved, all to please His heart,
 7  For my Beloved, that His life be shown.
 
 8  Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;
 8  Love in such union is as death most strong,
 8  Ne'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced
 8  Till Thou on spices mountains come ere long.

 1  Jesus Himself drew near,
 1     And joined them as they walked,
 1  And soon their hearts began to burn,
 1     As of Himself He talked:
 1        Draw near, O Lord.
 
 2  Jesus Himself drew near,
 2     They were no longer sad;
 2  When He was walking at their side,
 2     How could they but be glad?
 2        Draw near, O Lord.
 
 3  Jesus Himself drew near,
 3     And all their doubts were solved;
 3  He showed them why Christ came to die,
 3     And what that death involved:
 3        Draw near, O Lord.
 
 4  Jesus Himself drew near,
 4     And at the journey's end
 4  They could not let Him leave them thus,

 1  Savior, I by faith am touching
 1     Thee, the source of every good;
 1  Virtue now, by faith am claiming,

Touching Thee, new life is glowing
   By Thy Spirit's burning flame;
Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
   Glory to Thy Holy Name!
 
 2  Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee

 2  All I am I open to Thee,
 2     All Thou art Thou giv'st to me.
 
Touching Thee, new life is glowing
   By Thy Spirit's burning flame;
Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
   Glory to Thy Holy Name!
 
 3  Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,
 3     O most mighty King of kings;
 3  Of Thy fulness now receiving,
 3     High I mount on eagle wings.
 
Touching Thee, new life is glowing
   By Thy Spirit's burning flame;
Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
   Glory to Thy Holy Name!
 
 4  Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom,
 4     All my need, by Thee supplied;
 4  Keep me touching, keep me claiming,
 4     Keep me ever at Thy side.
 
Touching Thee, new life is glowing
   By Thy Spirit's burning flame;
Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
   Glory to Thy Holy Name!

 1  Come, O Thou Traveler unknown,
 1  Whom still I hold but cannot see;
 1  My company before is gone,
 1  And I am left alone with Thee;
 1  With Thee all night I mean to stay,
 1  And wrestle till the break of day.
 
 2  I need not tell Thee who I am,
 2  My sin and misery declare;
 2  Thyself hast called me by my name,
 2  Look on Thy hands, and read it there;
 2  But who, I ask Thee, who art Thou?
 2  Tell me Thy name, and tell me now.
 
 3  In vain Thou strugglest to get free;
 3  I never will unloose my hold;
 3  Art Thou the Man that died for me?
 3  The secret of Thy love unfold;
 3  Wrestling, I will not let Thee go,
 3  Till I Thy name, Thy nature know.
 
 4  Yield to me now, for I am weak,
 4  But confident in self-despair;
 4  Speak to my heart, in blessings speak,
 4  Be conquered by my instant prayer;
 4  Speak, or Thou never hence shalt move,
 4  And tell me if Thy name be Love.
 
 5  'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Thou diedst for me;
 5  I hear Thy whisper in my heart;
 5  The morning breaks, the shadows flee:
 5  Pure, universal Love Thou art;
 5  To me, to all Thy mercies move;
 5  Thy nature and Thy name is Love.
 
 6  Lame as I am, I take the prey;
 6  Hell, earth and sin, with ease o'ercome.
 6  I leap for joy, pursue my way,
 6  And, as a bounding hart, I run,
 6  Through all eternity to prove
 6  Thy nature and Thy name is Love.

 1  Thou hast said Thou art the Vine, Lord,
 1     And that I'm a branch in Thee,
 1  But I do not know the reason
 1     Why I should so barren be.
 
 2  Bearing fruit is my deep longing,
 2     More Thy life to manifest,
 2  To Thy throne to bring more glory,
 2     That Thy will may be expressed.
 
 3  But I fail to understand, Lord,
 3     What it means - "abide in me"
 3  For the more I seek "abiding,"
 3     More I feel I'm not in Thee.
 
 4  How I feel I'm not abiding;
 4     Though I pray and strongly will,
 4  Yet from me Thou seemest distant
 4     And my life is barren still.
 
 5  Yet Thou art the Vine, Thou saidst it,
 5     And I am a branch in Thee;
 5  When I take Thee as my Savior,
 5     Then this fact is wrought in me.
 
 6  Now I'm in Thee and I need not
 6     Seek into Thyself to come,
 6  For I'm joined to Thee already,
 6     With Thy flesh and bones I'm one.
 
 7  Not to "go in" is the secret,
 7     But that I'm "already in"!
 7  That I ne'er may leave I'd ask Thee,
 7     Not how I may get within.
 
 8  I am in, already in Thee!
 8     What a place to which I'm brought!
 8  There's no need for prayer or struggling,
 8     God Himself the work has wrought.
 
 9  Since I'm in, why ask to enter;
 9     O how ignorant I've been!
 9  Now with praise and much rejoicing
 9     For Thy Word, I dwell therein.
 
 10  Now in Thee I rest completely,
 10     With myself I gladly part;
 10  Thou art life and Thou art power,
 10     All in all to me Thou art.

 1  I have learned the wondrous secret
 1     Of abiding in the Lord;
 1  I have tasted life's pure fountain,
 1     I am drinking of His word;
 1  I have found the strength and sweetness
 1     Of abiding 'neath the blood;
 1  I have lost myself in Jesus,
 1     I am sinking into God.
 
I'm abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
 
 2  I am crucified with Jesus,
 2     And He lives and dwells with me;
 2  I have ceased from all my struggling,
 2     'Tis no longer I, but He.
 2  All my will is yielding to Him,
 2     And His Spirit reigns within;
 2  And His precious blood each moment
 2     Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.
 
I'm abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
 
 3  All my sicknesses I bring Him,
 3     And He bears them all away;
 3  All my fears and griefs I tell Him,
 3     All my cares from day to day,
 3  All my strength I draw from Jesus,
 3     By His breath I live and move;
 3  E'en His very mind He gives me,
 3     And His faith, and life, and love.
 
I'm abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
 
 4  For my words I take His wisdom,
 4     For my works His Spirit's power;
 4  For my ways His ceaseless presence
 4     Guards and guides me every hour.
 4  Of my heart, He is the portion,
 4     Of my joy the boundless spring;
 4  Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,
 4     Glorious Lord, and coming King.
 
I'm abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

I am trusting, fully trusting,

 3  Though my way be hid in darkness,
 3     Never can His light grow dim.
 
I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word;
I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word.
 
 4  All my joys I give to Jesus,
 4     He is all I want of bliss;
 4  He of all the worlds is Master;

I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word;
I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word.
 
 5  All I am I give to Jesus;
 5     All my body, all my soul;
 5  All I have, and all I hope for;
 5     While eternal ages roll.
 
I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word;
I am trusting, fully trusting,
   Sweetly trusting in His word.

 1  Thou whose name is called Jesus,
 1     Risen Lord of life and pow'r,
 1  Oh, it is so sweet to trust Thee,
 1     Every day and every hour;
 1  Of Thy wondrous grace I sing,
 1     Savior, Counsellor, and King.
 
 2  Thou canst keep my feet from falling,
 2     Even my poor wayward feet;
 2  Thou who dost present me faultless
 2     In Thee - Righteousness complete;
 2  Jesus, Lord, in knowing Thee,
 2     Oh, what strength and victory.
 
 3  All the sin in me, my Savior,
 3     Thou canst conquer and subdue;
 3  With Thy sanctifying power
 3     Permeate my spirit through;
 3  Let Thy government increase,
 3     Risen, crowned, Prince of Peace.
 
 4  Thou canst keep my upward looking,
 4     Ever upward in Thy face;
 4  Thou canst make me stand, upholden
 4     By the greatness of Thy grace;
 4  Every promise of Thy word
 4     Now I claim from Thee, dear Lord.
 
 5  Oh! what joy to trust Thee, Jesus,
 5     Mighty Victor o'er the grave,
 5  And to learn amid earth's shadows
 5     Thine unceasing power to save!
 5  Only those who prove Thee know
 5     What the grace Thou dost bestow.
 
 6  Make my life a bright outshining
 6     Of Thy life, that all my see
 6  Thine own resurrection power
 6     Mightily put forth in me;
 6  Ever let my heart become
 6     Yet more consciously Thy home.

 1  Jesus hath died and hath risen again,
 1     Pardon and peace to bestow;
 1  Fully I trust Him; from sin's guilty stain,
 1     Jesus saves me now.
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;
 
 2  Sin's condemnation is over and gone,
 2     Jesus alone knoweth how;
 2  Life and salvation my soul hath put on:
 2     Jesus saves me now.
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;
 
 3  Satan may tempt, but he never shall reign,
 3     That Christ will never allow;
 3  Doubts I have buried, and this is my strain,
 3     Jesus saves me now.
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;
 
 4  Resting in Jesus, abiding in Him,
 4     Gladly in faith can avow,
 4  Never again need my pathway be dim:
 4     Jesus saves me now.
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;
 
 5  Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin,
 5     Satan to Jesus must bow;
 5  Therefore I triumph without and within:
 5     Jesus saves me now.
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;
 
 6  Sorrow and pain may beset me about,
 6     Nothing can darken my brow;
 6  Battling in faith, I can joyfully shout:
 6     "Jesus saves me now."
 
   Jesus saves me now,
   Jesus saves me now;
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
   Jesus saves me now;

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Once I thought I walked with Jesus,
 1     Yet such changeful feelings had;
 1  Sometimes trusting, sometimes doubting,
 1     Sometimes joyful, sometimes sad.
 
Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
   Peace I never knew before;
And my way has brighter grown
   Since I've learned to trust Him more.
 
 2  But He call'd me closer to Him,
 2     Bade my doubting, fearing, cease;
 2  And when I had fully yielded,
 2     Filled my soul with perfect peace.
 
Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
   Peace I never knew before;
And my way has brighter grown
   Since I've learned to trust Him more.
 
 3  Now I'm trusting every moment,
 3     Nothing less can be enough;
 3  And the Savior bears me gently
 3     O'er those places once so rough.
 
Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
   Peace I never knew before;
And my way has brighter grown
   Since I've learned to trust Him more.
 
 4  Day by day my soul He's keeping
 4     By His wondrous power within;
 4  And my heart is full of singing
 4     To my Savior from all sin.
 
Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
   Peace I never knew before;
And my way has brighter grown
   Since I've learned to trust Him more.

 1  Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child
 1  Thru sunshine or thru tempests wild;
 1     Jesus, I trust in Thee:
 1  Thine is such wondrous pow'r to save;
 1  Thine is the mighty love that gave
 1     Its all on Calvary.
 
 2  O glorious Savior, Thee I praise;
 2  To Thee my new glad song I raise,

 2  Thy grace is boundless in its store;
 2  Thy face of love shines evermore;
 2     Thou givest me Thy heart.
 
 3  Upon Thy promises I stand,
 3  Trusting in Thee: Thine own right hand
 3     Doth keep and comfort me;
 3  My soul doth triumph in Thy word;
 3  Thine, Thine be all the praise, dear Lord,
 3     As Thine the victory.
 
 4  Love perfecteth what it begins;
 4  Thy power doth save me from my sins;

 4  This life of trust, how glad, how sweet;
 4  My need and Thy great fulness meet,
 4     And I have all in Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length,
 1  And breadth and fulness, as my daily strength;
 1  Into life's future fearless I may gaze,
 1  For, Savior, Thou art with me all the days.
 
 2  Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,
 2  New scenes surround my life and fancies strange;
 2  I thank Thee that no day can ever break,
 2  Savior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake.
 
 3  There may be days of darkness and distress,
 3  When sin has power to tempt, and care to press,
 3  Yet in the darkest day I will not fear,
 3  For, 'mid the shadows, Thou wilt still be near.
 
 4  Days there may be of joy and deep delight,
 4  When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,
 4  Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest
 4  Elsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast.
 
 5  And all the other days that make my life,
 5  Marked by no special joy or grief or strife,
 5  Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care,
 5  Burdens too small for other hearts to share;
 
 6  Spend Thou these days with me, all shall be Thine,
 6  So shall the darkest hour with glory shine.
 6  Then when these earthly years have passed away,
 6  Let me be with Thee in the perfect day.

   I give myself to Thee,
And Thou, according to Thy word,

 5  And all His risen life I claim,
 5     "I take" - "He undertakes."
 
   I take Thee, blessed Lord,
   I give myself to Thee,
And Thou, according to Thy word,
   Dost undertake for me.

 1  When I fear my faith will fail,
 1     Christ will hold me fast;
 1  When the tempter would prevail,
 1     He can hold me fast.
 
   He will hold me fast,
   He will hold me fast;
For my Savior loves me so,
   He will hold me fast.
 
 2  I could never keep my hold,
 2     He will hold me fast;
 2  For my love is often cold,
 2     He must hold me fast.
 
   He will hold me fast,
   He will hold me fast;
For my Savior loves me so,
   He will hold me fast.
 
 3  I am precious in His sight,
 3     He will hold me fast;
 3  Those He saves are His delight,
 3     He will hold me fast.
 
   He will hold me fast,
   He will hold me fast;
For my Savior loves me so,
   He will hold me fast.
 
 4  He'll not let my soul be lost,
 4     Christ will hold me fast;
 4  Bought by Him at such as cost,
 4     He will hold me fast.
 
   He will hold me fast,
   He will hold me fast;
For my Savior loves me so,
   He will hold me fast.

 1  Jesus! I am resting, resting
 1  In the joy of what Thou art;
 1  I am finding out the greatness

 1  Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
 1  And Thy beauty fills my soul,
 1  For, by Thy transforming power,
 1     Thou hast made me whole.
 
Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
   Of Thy loving heart.
 
 2  Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
 2  Vaster, broader than the sea;
 2  Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,
 2     Lavished all on me!
 2  Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
 2  Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
 2  Know Thy certainty of promise,
 2     And have made it mine.
 
Jesus! I am resting, resting

Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
   Of Thy loving heart.
 
 4  Ever lift Thy face upon me,
 4  As I work and wait for Thee;
 4  Resting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
 4     Earth's dark shadows flee.
 4  Brightness of my Father's glory,
 4  Sunshine of my Father's face,
 4  Keep me ever trusting, resting,
 4     Fill me with Thy grace.
 
Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
   Of Thy loving heart.

 1  Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,
 1  Resting on the fulness of His own sure word,
 1  Resting on His wisdom, on His love and pow'r,
 1  Resting on His covenant from hour to hour.
 
 2  Resting 'neath His guiding hand for untrack'd days,
 2  Resting 'neath His shadow from noontide rays,
 2  Resting at the eventide beneath His wing,
 2  In the glorious presence of our Savior King.
 
 3  Resting in the fortress while the foe is nigh,
 3  Resting in the lifeboat while the waves roll high,
 3  Resting in His chariot for the swift, glad race,
 3  Resting, always resting, in His boundless grace.
 
 4  Resting in the pastures and beneath the Rock,
 4  Resting by the waters where He leads His flock,
 4  Resting, while we listen, at His glorious feet,
 4  Resting in His very arms, oh, rest complete!
 
 5  Resting and believing, let us onward press;
 5  Resting on Himself, the Lord our righteousness;
 5  Resting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing,
 5  Glory, glory, glory be to Christ our King!

 1  On Thee my heart is resting,
 1     Ah, this is rest indeed:
 1  What else, Almighty Savior,
 1     Can a poor sinner need?
 1  Thy light is all my wisdom,
 1     Thy love is all my stay;
 1  Thy coming back in glory,
 1     Draws nearer every day.
 
On Thee my heart is resting,
   Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
   Can a poor sinner need?
 
 2  My guilt is great, but greater
 2     The mercy Thou dost give;
 2  Thyself, a spotless Off'ring,
 2     Hast died that I should live.
 2  With Thee, my soul unfettered
 2     Has risen from the dust;
 2  Thy blood is all my treasure,
 2     Thy word is all my trust.
 
On Thee my heart is resting,
   Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
   Can a poor sinner need?
 
 3  Through me, Thou gentle Master,
 3     Thy purposes fulfil;
 3  I yield myself forever
 3     To Thy most holy will.
 3  What though I be but weakness?
 3     My strength is not in me;
 3  The poorest of Thy people
 3     Has all things, having Thee.
 
On Thee my heart is resting,
   Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
   Can a poor sinner need?
 
 4  When clouds are darkest round me,
 4     Thou, Lord, art then most near,
 4  My drooping faith to quicken,
 4     My weary soul to cheer.
 4  Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
 4     I gaze upon Thy face;
 4  In vain my foes would drive me
 4     From Thee, my hiding-place.
 
On Thee my heart is resting,
   Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
   Can a poor sinner need?
 
 5  'Tis Thou hast made me happy,
 5     'Tis Thou hast set me free;
 5  To whom shall I give glory
 5     Forever, but to Thee?
 5  Of earthly love and blessing
 5     Should every stream run dry,
 5  Thy grace shall still be with me,
 5     Thy grace, to live and die.
 
On Thee my heart is resting,
   Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
   Can a poor sinner need?

 1     When we walk with the Lord
 1     In the light of His Word,
 1  What a glory He sheds on our way;
 1     While we do His good will,
 1     He abides with us still,
 1  And with all who will trust and obey.
 
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
 
 2     Not a shadow can rise,
 2     Not a cloud in the skies,
 2  But His smile quickly drives it away;
 2     Not a doubt or a fear,
 2     Not a sigh or a tear,
 2  Can abide while we trust and obey.
 
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
 
 3     Not a burden we bear,
 3     Not a shadow we share,
 3  But our toil He doth richly repay;
 3     Not a grief or a loss,
 3     Not a frown or a cross,
 3  But is blest if we trust and obey.
 
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
 
 4     But we never can prove
 4     The delights of His love,
 4  Until all on the altar we lay;
 4     For the favor He shows,
 4     And the joy He bestows,
 4  Are for them who will trust and obey.
 
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.
 
 5     Then in fellowship sweet
 5     We will sit at His feet,
 5  Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
 5     What He says we will do;
 5     Where He sends we will go,
 5  Never fear, only trust and obey.
 
Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

 1  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 1  His reproach to gladly bear.
 1  Suffered He without the gate,
 1  How can I in comfort share?
 
 2  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 2  Willing e'en to bear the cross;
 2  He has trod the narrow way,
 2  I will follow, suff'ring loss.
 
 3  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 3  Dear ones, relatives forsake;
 3  He the Father's will did mind,
 3  In His passion I partake.
 
 4  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 4  His companion I will be;
 4  Never join religion's ranks
 4  Or the world's society.
 
 5  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 5  Though the path be lone and grim;
 5  Let all human friends desert,
 5  I am satisfied with Him.
 
 6  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 6  There to walk with Him, how blest!
 6  E'er to see His smiling face
 6  Ever in His presence rest.
 
 7  Go to Him "without the camp,"
 7  Till the dawning of the day;
 7  Then I'll see Him and rejoice,
 7  With Him in His kingdom stay.

 1  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
 1  Anywhere He leads me in this world below.
 1  Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;
 1  Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.
 
Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
 
 2  Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,
 2  Other friends may fail me, He is still my own.
 2  Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
 2  Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.
 
Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
 
 3  Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,

 3  Knowing I shall waken never more to roam,
 3  Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
 
Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

 1  He leadeth me! O blessed thought,
 1  O words with heav'nly comfort fraught;
 1  Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
 1  Still 'tis Christ's hand that leadeth me.
 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.
 
 2  Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
 2  Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
 2  By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
 2  Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me.
 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.
 
 3  Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
 3  Nor ever murmur or repine;
 3  Content, whatever lot I see,
 3  Since it is Thou that leadest me.
 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.
 
 4  And when my task on earth is done,
 4  When, by Thy grace, the vict'ry's won,
 4  E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
 4  Since Thou in triumph leadest me.
 
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

 1  I can hear my Savior calling,
 1  In the tend'rest accents calling;
 1  On my ear these words are falling,
 1  "Take thy cross, and daily follow me."
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
 
 2  Though the way be dark and dreary,
 2  Though my feet be worn and weary,
 2  Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery
 2  As I follow, follow all the way.
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
 
 3  Savior, ever go before me,
 3  Shining heaven's sunlight o'er me,
 3  And when weak, by grace restore me
 3  As I follow, follow all the way.
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
 
 4  Through the valley safely lead me,
 4  Heav'nly manna daily feed me;
 4  Every hour, dear Lord, I need Thee
 4  As I follow, follow all the way.
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
 
 5  In Thy heart's affection hold me,
 5  In Thy arms of love enfold me,
 5  And with Thine own grace uphold me,
 5  As I follow, follow all the way.
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.
 
 6  I would never leave Thee, never;
 6  Faithful I would be forever;
 6  Nothing from Thy love can sever
 6  As I follow, follow all the way.
 
I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

 1  'Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,
 1     Step by step and day by day;
 1  Stepping in His very footprints,
 1     Walking with Him all the way.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 2  'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,
 2     Leaning hard upon His arm,
 2  Following closely where He leads us,
 2     None can hurt and naught can harm.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 3  Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,
 3     Just a moment at a time,
 3  Heights I have not wings to soar to,
 3     Step by step my feet can climb.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 4  All the way I'll walk with Jesus,
 4     Through the sunshine, through the gloom,
 4  Though His blood-marked steps may lead me
 4     To the garden, to the tomb.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 5  Here a while we walk with Jesus,
 5     But the time will not be long
 5  Till the night shall change to morning,
 5     And the sorrow into song.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 6  Then, with all who walked with Jesus,
 6     We shall walk with Him in white,
 6  While He turns our grief to gladness,
 6     And our darkness into light.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.
 
 7  Jesus, keep me closer - closer,
 7     Step by step, and day by day;
 7  Stepping in Thy very footprints,
 7     Walking with Thee all the way.
 
Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
Keeping step with Jesus.

 1  O blessed life - the heart at rest
 1  When all without tumultuous seems,
 1  That trusts a higher will, and deems
 1  That higher will, not mine, the best.
 
 2  O blessed life, the mind that sees,
 2  Whatever change the years may bring,
 2  A mercy still in everything,
 2  And shining through all mysteries.
 
 3  O blessed life, as spirit soars,
 3  When sense of mortal sight is dim,
 3  Beyond the sense, beyond to Him,
 3  Whose love unlocks the glorious doors.
 
 4  O blessed life, heart, mind, and soul,
 4  From self-born aims and wishes free,
 4  In all at one with Deity,
 4  And loyal to the Lord's control.
 
 5  O life, how blessed, how divine,
 5  High life, the earnest of a higher;
 5  Savior, fulfil my deep desire,
 5  And let this blessed life be mine.

 1  God in heaven hath a treasure,
 1     Riches none may count or tell;
 1  Hath a deep eternal pleasure,
 1     Christ the Son, He loveth well.
 1  God hath here on earth a treasure,
 1     None but He its price may know -
 1  Deep, unfathomable pleasure,
 1     Christ revealed in saints below.
 
 2  God in tongues of fire descending,
 2     Chosen vessels thus to fill
 2  With the treasure never ending,
 2     Ever spent - unfailing still.
 2  God's own hand the vessel filling
 2     From the glory far above,
 2  Longing hearts forever stilling
 2     With the riches of His love.
 
 3  Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,
 3     Glorious calling, saint, is thine;
 3  Let the Lord but find thee emptied,
 3     Living branch in Christ the Vine!
 3  Vessels of the world's despising,
 3     Vessels weak and poor and base,
 3  Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing,
 3     Glory from Christ's blessed face.
 
 4  Oh to be but emptier, lowlier,
 4     Mean, unnoticed - and unknown,
 4  And to God a vessel holier,
 4     Filled with Christ and Christ alone!
 4  Naught of earth to cloud the glory,
 4     Naught of self the light to dim,
 4  Telling forth His wondrous story,
 4     Emptied to be filled with Him.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  All I have in Adam is but sin and death,
 1  I in Christ inherit life and righteousness;
 1  When in flesh abiding, Adam I express,
 1  But when in the spirit Christ is manifest.
 
 2  When I am in Adam, though I may not sin,
 2  Unto death, a sinner, sentenced I have been;
 2  When in Christ I need not righteously to act,
 2  I'm already righteous, justified in fact.
 
 3  In the flesh I need no effort to express
 3  Marks of Adam's nature and its sinfulness;
 3  In the spirit I need not to strive or strain,
 3  I can live as He is and in spirit reign.
 
 4  Thru my death with Christ, from Adam I am free,
 4  Thru my life with Christ, new life is given me!
 4  Minding not the flesh, old Adam cannot move,
 4  Minding just the spirit, life divine I prove.
 
 5  Minding just the spirit is God's saving way,
 5  Minding just the spirit, Christ we will display;
 5  Minding just the spirit, we can overcome,
 5  Minding just the spirit, we the race may run.
 
 6  Minding just the spirit, we the cross will know,
 6  And His resurrection pow'r thru us will flow;
 6  Minding just the spirit, Christ will live thru me,
 6  And His life within will reach maturity.
 
 7  In the spirit Christ is life and all to me,
 7  Strengthening and blessing all-inclusively;
 7  Living in the spirit, holiness I prove,
 7  And the triune God within my heart doth move.

 1  Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,
 1     Ever issued from His store;
 1  To His own He gives full measure,
 1     Running over, evermore.
 
 2  There is always something over,

 2  Take our portion with thanksgiving,
 2     Praising for the things He planned.
 2  Satisfaction, full and deepening,
 2     All our need He doth supply.
 2  When the heart has tasted Jesus
 2     Its desires to satisfy.
 
 3  There is always something over,
 3     When we share in all His love;
 3  Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,
 3     Unscaled heights rise far above.
 3  Human lips can never utter
 3     All His wondrous tenderness.
 3  We can only praise and wonder
 3     And His Name forever bless.

 1  Mine is the earth, the worlds in all their fulness;
 1     Mine, every ocean, river, plain, and hill;
 1  Mine are the stars within the heaven's stillness,
 1     Mine are the clouds that wander at their will.
 
 2  Mine is the spring, when blossoms sweet are blowing,
 2     Wakened from slumb'ring neath the winter snow;
 2  Mine, summer's wealth, with her bright colors glowing;
 2     Mine is the fruit rich autumn doth bestow.
 
 3  Mine, all the things created: praise the Giver!
 3     Fish, and all beasts, the birds upon the wing,
 3  Sun-loving butterflies - now and forever;
 3     Beauty and grace of every living thing.
 
 4  Mine, all things lovely, blessing every hour,
 4     Wealth of creation, over and around;
 4  Mine is the sun, with its life-giving power,
 4     Mine is the music wonderful of sound.
 
 5  Mine are the pillars which cannot be shaken -
 5     Truth in the Word, the Word that cannot fall.
 5  Mine is the wisdom which great thoughts awaken
 5     In a man's soul, that this life is not all.
 
 6  Knowledge as needed, skill in all the doing,
 6     Mine, when kept closely for my Lord above;
 6  Beauty and wisdom, living streams e'er flowing
 6     Fresh from the springs of God, the God of love.
 
 7  Mine are the battles, triumph-shouts e'er ringing -
 7     Joy of the warriors for the truth and right;
 7  Mine are the trophies God's brave ones are bringing,
 7     Heroes of faith and overcoming might.
 
 8  Mine, mercies granted, and each new awaking,
 8     Every experience, and each soul that's won;
 8  Mine, the confessions sinners poor are making,
 8     Yea, I am joined with them, one in God's Son.
 
 9  One Lord in all, and all one in His Spirit,
 9     Heavenly fellowship earth has not known;
 9  Faith sees the riches we shall yet inherit,
 9     Glorious treasure laid up for His own.
 
 10  All in the bounds of earth and sea and heaven,
 10     Creation's wonders and Thy grace are stored:
 10  Praise to Thee, Christ, for all the wealth
 10     Thou'st given!
 10  Poor in myself, but wealthy in the Lord!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  All fair within those children of the light,
 1  Though dark their brows beneath the desert sun;
 1  Mysterious joys, far hidden from all sight,
 1  The King of Glory giveth to each one;
 1     No thought of man has pictured them,
 1     No hand may touch that diadem;
 1     Within God's light His own abide
 1     With hidden glory glorified.
 
 2  To earthly eyes they are as Adam's race -
 2  They wear the earthly form, and scars of pain
 2  On them as on all sinners leave their trace;
 2  Their outward needs are those of other men.
 2     And theirs the forms of earthly life,
 2     Theirs sleeping, waking, want, and strife,
 2     Yet this they have that they despise
 2     What fairest seems to earthly eyes.
 
 3  And inwardly their life is from above,
 3  The Lord's Almighty Word hath quickened them;
 3  Flames kindled from the everlasting Love,
 3  The children of the New Jerusalem;
 3     Their brethren are the saints in light,
 3     And songs of sweetness infinite
 3     They sing with them to God Most High,
 3     A deep and wondrous melody.
 
 4  They walk upon the earth, and dwell in heaven,
 4  Though pow'rless, guard the world with arms unseen;
 4  Deep peace to them in midst of strife is given,
 4  And all they wish they have, though poor and mean.
 4     Storms beat them, but may not destroy,
 4     Fast rooted in eternal joy;
 4     They walk as in the shade of death,
 4     Yet living on in silent faith.
 
 5  When Christ their Life shall be made manifest,
 5  When He shall come with all His pow'r to rule,
 5  Their glory, hidden long, shall be confessed;
 5  Arise and shine! O bright and beautiful!
 5     With Christ ye shall ascend on high,
 5     Victorious in His victory -
 5     The hidden light shall shine afar,
 5     Each saint an everlasting star.

 1  Lord, I was blind; I could not see
 1  In Thy marred visage any grace,
 1  But now the beauty of Thy face
 1  In radiant vision dawns on me.
 
 2  Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear
 2  The thrilling music of Thy voice;
 2  But now I hear Thee and rejoice,
 2  And all Thine uttered words are dear!
 
 3  Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak
 3  The grace and glory of Thy name;
 3  But now, as touched with living flame,
 3  My lips Thine eager praises wake.
 
 4  Lord, I was dead; I could not stir
 4  My lifeless soul to come to Thee;
 4  But now, since Thou hast quickened me,
 4  I rise from sin's dark sepulcher.
 
 5  For Thou hast made the blind to see,
 5  The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
 5  The dead to live; and, lo, I break
 5  The chains of my captivity.

 1  My God, my Portion, and my Love,
 1     My everlasting All,
 1  I've none but Thee in heav'n above,
 1     Or on this earthly ball,
 1     Or on this earthly ball.
 
 2  What empty things are all the skies,
 2     And this inferior clod!
 2  There's nothing here deserves my joys,
 2     There's nothing like my God,
 2     There's nothing like my God.
 
 3  To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
 3     And health, and safe abode;
 3  Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
 3     But they are not my God,
 3     But they are not my God.
 
 4  How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
 4     If once compared to Thee!
 4  Or what's my safety, or my health,
 4     Or all my friends to me,
 4     Or all my friends to me.
 
 5  Were I possessor of the earth,
 5     And called the stars my own,
 5  Without Thy graces and Thyself,
 5     I were a wretch undone,
 5     I were a wretch undone.
 
 6  Let others stretch their arms like seas,
 6     And grasp in all the shore;
 6  Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
 6     And I desire no more,
 6     And I desire no more.

 1  My heart is resting, O my God,
 1     I will give thanks and sing;
 1  My heart is at the secret source
 1     Of every precious thing.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 2  Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,
 2     No hand but Thine shall fill;
 2  The waters of the earth have failed,
 2     And I am thirsty still.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 3  I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
 3     And here all day they rise;
 3  I seek the treasure of Thy love,
 3     And close at hand it lies.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 4  A glad, new song is in my mouth,
 4     To long-loved music set,
 4  A song of praise for all the grace
 4     I have not tasted yet.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 5  I have a heritage of joy
 5     That yet I must not see;
 5  The hand that bled to make it mine
 5     Is keeping it for me.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 6  There is a certainty of love
 6     That sets my heart at rest;
 6  A calm assurance for today
 6     That to be poor is best.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.
 
 7  A prayer reposing on His truth,
 7     Who hath made all things mine;
 7  That draws my captive will to Him,
 7     And makes it one with Thine.
 
Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
   I daily, hourly sing;
My heart is at the secret source
   Of every precious thing.

 1  O how glorious! O how holy!
 1     God is the eternal life!
 1  Full, unlimited, and pow'rful,
 1     Pure, and merciful, and bright!
 1  In this life are all His riches,
 1     All His nature, love and light.
 
 2  O how loving! O how gracious!
 2     God Himself is life to man!
 2  He in man hath made a spirit
 2     That He might fulfill His plan.
 2  'Tis His heart's delight and longing
 2     E'er to be received by man.
 
 3  O what love and grace unbounded!
 3     God as life to man doth flow!
 3  He no more is hid in secret
 3     But Himself to man doth show,
 3  First in flesh and then as Spirit
 3     That His life all men may know.
 
 4  How approachable! How near us!
 4     God in Christ our life to be!
 4  Christ is God in flesh incarnate,
 4     Manifest for man to see.
 4  Died and risen, now He enters
 4     Into man, his life to be.
 
 5  O what wonder! As the Spirit
 5     God as life to man is shown!
 5  'Tis His other transformation,
 5     He as Spirit thus is know;
 5  Men convicting and inspiring,
 5     He within them makes His home.
 
 6  O how glorious! O how precious!
 6     Thus the triune God to know!
 6  First the Father in the Son came,
 6     Now the Son as Spirit flows.
 6  When in man the Spirit enters
 6     God as life He doth bestow.
 
 7  How mysterious, yet how real!
 7     God Himself now flows in me!
 7  In my heart, with me in oneness,
 7     He has come my life to be.
 7  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 7     I will praise unceasingly!

 1  Eternal Light! Eternal Light!
 1     How pure the soul must be
 1  When, placed within Thy searching sight,
 1  It shrinks not, but with calm delight
 1     Can live and look on Thee.
 
 2  The spirits that surround Thy throne
 2     May bear the burning bliss;
 2  But that is surely theirs alone,
 2  Since they have never, never known
 2     A fallen world like this.
 
 3  Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere
 3     Is dark, whose mind is dim,
 3  Before th' Ineffable appear,
 3  And on my natural spirit bear
 3     The uncreated beam?
 
 4  There is a way for man to rise
 4     To Thee, sublime Abode;
 4  And Offering and a Sacrifice,
 4  A Holy Spirit's energies,
 4     An Advocate with God:
 
 5  These, these prepare us for the sight
 5     Of holiness above;
 5  The sons of ignorance and night
 5  May dwell in the eternal Light,
 5     Through the eternal Love.

 1  My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,
 1  And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;
 1  He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,
 1  Within the holiest at home with God.
 1  O holy place! O home divinely fair!
 1  And we, God's little ones, abiding there.
 
 2  A long, long road I traveled night and day,
 2  And sought to find within myself some way,
 2  Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;
 2  Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,
 2  And then I found Christ was the only way
 2  That I must come to Him and in Him stay.
 
 3  O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!
 3  And I, God's little one, safe hidden there.
 3  Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,
 3  So make me dead to everything but Thee;
 3  That as I rest within my home most fair,
 3  I'll share my God in all and everywhere.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  Oh, how the thought of God attracts
 1     And draws the heart from earth,
 1  And sickens it of passing shows
 1     And dissipating mirth!
 
 2  'Tis not enough to save our souls,
 2     To shun th' eternal fires;
 2  The thought of God will rouse the heart
 2     To more sublime desires.
 
 3  God only is the creature's home,
 3     Though rough and straight the road;
 3  Yet nothing less can satisfy
 3     The love that longs for God.
 
 4  Oh, utter but the Name of God
 4     Down in your heart of hearts,
 4  And see how from the world at once
 4     All tempting light departs.
 
 5  A trusting heart, a yearning eye,
 5     Can win their way above;
 5  If mountains can be moved by faith,
 5     Is there less power in love?
 
 6  How little of that road, my soul!
 6     How little hast thou gone!
 6  Take heart, and let the thought of God
 6     Allure thee further on.
 
 7  The freedom from all willful sin,
 7     The Christian's daily task;
 7  Oh! These are graces far below
 7     What longing love would ask!
 
 8  The perfect way is hard to flesh;
 8     It is not hard to love;
 8  If thou wert sick from want of God,
 8     How swiftly wouldst thou move!
 
 9  Then keep thy conscience sensitive;
 9     No inward token miss:
 9  And go where grace entices thee -
 9     Perfection lies in this.

 1  I praise Thee for Thy mystery,
 1  That I may truly contact Thee;
 1  In unapproachable light Thou wast
 1  But now as Spirit nigh to me.
 
 2  The Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou,
 2  The triune God, my life fore'er;
 2  In me Thou art the full supply
 2  That I Thy holy nature share.
 
 3  The triune God the Spirit is,
 3  And comes as breath and wind to me;
 3  'Tis thus I may experience
 3  The Godhead's wondrous mystery.
 
 4  All that the Father is and has
 4  In His beloved Son doth rest,
 4  And all the riches of the Son
 4  Are by the Spirit now possessed.
 
 5  The Spirit doth descend on me
 5  And to my spirit enters in,
 5  That He, the Father in the Son,
 5  My blessed portion be within.
 
 6  The Father is the fountainhead,
 6  The Son expression gives to Him;
 6  The Spirit is His very flow,
 6  As my reality within.
 
 7  The Father in the Son has come
 7  That God to man Himself may show;
 7  The Son as Spirit enters me
 7  That God I inwardly may know.
 
 8  The Father purposed that the Son
 8  Should be the first in everything;
 8  The Son the Father takes as Head
 8  And over all His headship brings.
 
 9  The Spirit perfectly desires
 9  That Christ, the Son, be glorified,
 9  And He reveals Him unto me,
 9  That He be fully testified.
 
 10  Thy final form the Spirit is,
 10  Our worship to receive within;
 10  If I Thy riches would enjoy,
 10  In spirit I must contact Him.
 
 11  If I in spirit worship Thee,
 11  In spirit live, in spirit pray,
 11  The Holy Spirit I will touch
 11  And Thee enjoy in every way.

 1  God's Spirit His transmission is,
 1  In Him God enters us;
 1  It is in Him that God in Christ
 1  May be experienced by us.
 
 2  God as the Father is the source,
 2  And God the Son doth Him express;
 2  God as the Spirit enters us,
 2  That God as all we may possess.
 
 3  The Father, who is veiled in light,
 3  The Son to man hath fully shown;
 3  The Spirit then transmitteth Him
 3  That He may inwardly be known.
 
 4  The Son within the Father is,
 4  And now the Spirit is the Son.
 4  The Spirit, Son, and Father God
 4  Are now in us and with us one.
 
 5  God as the Father in the Son
 5  Has been embodied and expressed,
 5  And God the Spirit is the Son's
 5  Reality to be possessed.
 
 6  May God the Father's love to us
 6  In God the Son as grace be known,
 6  Thru God the Spirit's fellowship,
 6  That God our portion we may own.

 1  God's glorious substance Spirit is,
 1  His essence, holy and divine;
 1  To contact God and Him enjoy,
 1  His Spirit I must touch with mine.
 
 2  The spirit is the innermost,
 2  The part of man most deep and real;
 2  If he would contact God in life,
 2  'Tis with the spirit he must deal.
 
 3  The worship which the Father seeks
 3  Is in the spirit's strength alone;
 3  His Spirit into man's would come,
 3  That His and man's may thus be one.
 
 4  When Spirit unto spirit calls
 4  The two commingle and are one;
 4  Man's spirit is the Spirit's home,
 4  The Spirit doth man's life become.
 
 5  Man's spirit must God's Spirit touch
 5  If in God's fulness he would live;
 5  'Tis only with the spirit thus
 5  That he to God may worship give.
 
 6  In ministry and fellowship
 6  Man to the spirit we must bring;
 6  All ministry should turn to prayer,
 6  Spirit to spirit answering.
 
 7  In spirit we must pray and serve,
 7  In spirit touch the life divine,
 7  In spirit grow, in spirit build,
 7  That Christ thru us may fully shine.
 
 8  Lord, to the spirit I would turn
 8  And learn to truly contact Thee;
 8  Thy Spirit thus will flow with mine
 8  And overflow eternally.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  God intends that all His being
 1     Be my full supply;
 1  With Him I must be united,
 1        In spirit nigh.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.
 
 2  All the riches of His nature
 2     He has given me;
 2  I must touch Him in the spirit,
 2        These to see.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.
 
 3  With the mind we understand Him,
 3     With the spirit touch;
 3  Those who never use the spirit
 3        Lack very much.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.
 
 4  When to messages I listen,
 4     I must pray them in;
 4  Thus the word will be digested
 4        From within.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.
 
 5  When the Word of God I study,
 5     I must touch the Lord;
 5  If in mind and not in spirit,
 5        Dead is the Word.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.
 
 6  O what riches, O what glory
 6     In the Spirit shine!
 6  When I exercise my spirit,
 6        All are mine.
 
All God's being, all His riches
   In the Spirit flow;
I must exercise my spirit
      Him to know.

 1  Thou sweet, beloved will of God,
 1     My anchor ground, my fortress hill,
 1  My spirit's silent, fair abode,
 1     In Thee I hide me and am still.
 
 2  O Will, that willest good alone,
 2     Lead Thou the way, Thou guidest best;
 2  A little child, I follow on,
 2     And, trusting, lean upon Thy breast.
 
 3  God's will doth make the bitter sweet,
 3     And all is well when it is done;
 3  Unless His will doth hallow it,
 3     The glory of all joy is gone.
 
 4  Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,
 4     Hold fast in its sublime embrace
 4  My captive will, a gladsome bird,
 4     Prisoned in such a realm of grace.
 
 5  Within this place of certain good
 5     Love evermore expands her wings,
 5  Or nestling in Thy perfect choice,
 5     Abides content with what it brings.
 
 6  Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke;
 6     It lifts, it bears my happy soul,
 6  It giveth wings to this poor heart;
 6     My freedom is Thy grand control.
 
 7  Upon God's will I lay me down,
 7     As child upon its mother's breast;
 7  No silken couch, nor softest bed,
 7     Could ever give me such deep rest.
 
 8  Thy wonderful grand will, my God,
 8     With triumph now I make it mine;
 8  And faith shall cry a joyous Yes
 8     To every dear command of Thine.

 1  On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
 1     The emblem of suff'ring and shame,
 1  And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best
 1     For a world of lost sinners was slain.
 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 2  Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
 2     Has a wondrous attraction for me;
 2  For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
 2     To bear it to dark Calvary.
 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 3  In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
 3     A wondrous beauty I see;
 3  For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
 3     To pardon and sanctify me.
 
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

 1  Beneath the cross of Jesus
 1     I fain would take my stand,
 1  The shadow of a might Rock
 1     Within a weary land;
 1  A rest upon the way,
 1     From the burning of the noontide heat,
 1  And the burden of the day.
 
 2  Oh, safe and happy shelter!
 2     Oh, refuge tried and sweet!
 2  Oh, trysting place where heaven's love
 2     And heaven's justice meet.
 2  As to the holy patriarch
 2     That wondrous dream was given,
 2  So is my Savior by the cross
 2     A ladder up to heaven.
 
 3  There lies beneath its shadow,
 3     But on the farther side,
 3  The darkness of an awful grave
 3     That gapes both deep and wide;
 3  And there between us stands the cross,
 3     Two arms outstretched to save,
 3  Like a watchman set to guard the way
 3     From that eternal grave.
 
 4  Upon that cross of Jesus
 4     Mine eyes at times can see
 4  The very dying form of One,
 4     Who suffered there for me;
 4  And from my smitten heart, with tears,
 4     Two wonders I confess,
 4  The wonders of His glorious love,
 4     And my own worthlessness.
 
 5  I take, O cross, thy shadow
 5     For my abiding place;
 5  I ask no other sunshine than
 5     The sunshine of His face;
 5  Content to let the world go by,
 5     To know no gain nor loss,
 5  My sinful self my only shame,
 5     My glory all the cross.

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  If we take the cross, will we but suffer pain?
 1  Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!
 1  The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;
 1  The cross experienced the self will crucify.
 
 2  Divine deliverance e'er slays man by the cross;
 2  Though cruel it may seem, it is a grand release.
 2  Christ ne'er will be our life if we escape the cross;
 2  Christ ne'er will be expressed but by our sure decease.
 
 3  The cross's final goal, that God's will be fulfilled;
 3  His will's arch enemy is but the self of man.
 3  If self be done away and all the soul-life killed,
 3  God's will shall then prevail and prospered be His plan.

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  There is no gain but by a loss;
 1  We cannot save but by the cross,
 1  The corn of wheat to multiply
 1  Must fall into the ground and die;
 1  O should a soul alone remain
 1  When it a hundredfold can gain?
 1  O should a soul alone remain
 1  When it a hundredfold can gain?
 
 2  Our souls are held by all they hold;
 2  Slaves still are slaves in chains of gold;
 2  To whatsoever we may cling,
 2  We make it a soul-chaining thing.
 2  Whether it be a life or land,
 2  And dear as our right eye or hand.
 2  Whether it be a life or land,
 2  And dear as our right eye or hand.
 
 3  Wherever you ripe fields behold,
 3  Waving to God their sheaves of gold,
 3  Be sure some corn of wheat has died,
 3  Some saintly soul been crucified;
 3  Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
 3  And fought hell's legions undismayed.
 3  Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
 3  And fought hell's legions undismayed.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  The heavier the cross, the nearer God;
 1  No cross without, no God within!
 1  The prince of darkness thus is trod,
 1  Amid the world's false glare and din.
 1  Oh, happy he, with all his loss,
 1  Whom God hath set beneath the cross.
 
 2  The heavier the cross, the better saint;
 2  This is the touchstone God applies.
 2  The gardens many would be faint,
 2  Unwet by showers from weeping eyes!
 2  The gold by fire is purified;
 2  The saint is by much trouble tried.
 
 3  The heavier the cross, the stronger faith:
 3  The loaded palm strikes deeper root;
 3  The vine juice sweetly issueth
 3  When men have pressed the clustered fruit;
 3  And courage grows where dangers come,
 3  Like pearls beneath the salty foam.
 
 4  The heavier the cross, the deeper prayer;
 4  The bruised herbs most fragrant are.
 4  If sky and wind were always fair,
 4  The sailor would not watch the star;
 4  And David's Psalms had ne'er been sung
 4  If grief his heart had never wrung.
 
 5  The heavier the cross, the more inspired;
 5  From vales to climb to mountain crest;
 5  The pilgrim, of the desert tired,
 5  Longs for the Canaan of his rest.
 5  The dove has here no rest in sight,
 5  And to the ark she wings her flight.
 
 6  The heavier the cross, the easier to die;
 6  Death is a kinder face to see;
 6  Our life's decay we dare defy,
 6  From life's distress we then are free.
 6  The cross sublimely lifts our faith
 6  To Him who triumphed over death.
 
 7  Thou Crucified! The cross I bear.
 7  The longer, may it dearer be;
 7  And lest I faint while ling'ring here,
 7  Implant Thou such a heart in me
 7  That faith and love may flourish e'er,
 7  Till for the cross the crown I wear.

 1  Olives that have known no pressure
 1     No oil can bestow;
 1  If the grapes escape the winepress,
 1     Cheering wine can never flow;
 1  Spikenard only through the crushing,
 1     Fragrance can diffuse.
 1  Shall I then, Lord, shrink from suff'ring
 1     Which Thy love for me would choose?
 
Each blow I suffer
Is true gain to me.
In the place of what Thou takest
Thou dost give Thyself to me.
 
 2  Do my heartstrings need Thy stretching,
 2     Songs divine to prove?
 2  Do I need for sweetest music
 2     Cruel treatment of Thy love?
 2  Lord, I fear no deprivation
 2     If it draws to Thee;
 2  I would yield in full surrender
 2     All Thy heart of love to see.
 
Each blow I suffer
Is true gain to me.
In the place of what Thou takest
Thou dost give Thyself to me.
 
 3  I'm ashamed, my Lord, for seeking
 3     Self to guard alway;
 3  Though Thy love has done its stripping,
 3     Yet I've been compelled this way.
 3  Lord, according to Thy pleasure
 3     Fully work on me;
 3  Heeding not my human feelings,
 3     Only do what pleases Thee.
 
Each blow I suffer
Is true gain to me.
In the place of what Thou takest
Thou dost give Thyself to me.
 
 4  If Thy mind and mine should differ,
 4     Still pursue Thy way;
 4  If Thy pleasure means my sorrow,
 4     Still my heart shall answer, "Yea!"
 4  'Tis my deep desire to please Thee,
 4     Though I suffer loss;
 4  E'en though Thy delight and glory
 4     Mean that I endure the cross.
 
Each blow I suffer
Is true gain to me.
In the place of what Thou takest
Thou dost give Thyself to me.
 
 5  Oh, I'll praise Thee, e'en if weeping
 5     Mingle with my song.
 5  Thine increasing sweetness calls forth
 5     Grateful praises all day long.
 5  Thou hast made Thyself more precious
 5     Than all else to me:
 5  Thou increase and I decrease, Lord -
 5     This is now my only plea.
 
Each blow I suffer
Is true gain to me.
In the place of what Thou takest
Thou dost give Thyself to me.

 2  I "glory in the Cross" most loving Lord,

 4  And know that I can never separate
 4        Its gain and loss.
 
 5  The daily Cross is daily loss to all
 5        That keeps from Thee;
 5  The daily Cross is daily gain of all
 5        Thou art for me.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  Via Bethlehem we journey,
 1  We whose hearts on God are set;
 1  Babe-like souls of Jesus learning,
 1  While our cheeks with tears are wet;
 1  For the manger and the stable
 1  Are not pleasant to our eyes,
 1  But our feet must follow Jesus,
 1  If our hands would grasp the prize.
 
 2  Via Nazareth! The pathway
 2  Narrows still as on we go,
 2  Years of toil none understanding,
 2  Yet God teaches us to know
 2  That the servant is not greater
 2  Than the Lord, who through long years
 2  Hid Himself from this world's glory,
 2  Follow Him! Count not the tears.
 
 3  Via Galilee, we see Him!
 3  Stones are hurled, and cursed hissed
 3  By the men who gather round Him,
 3  Has He not the pathway missed?
 3  No! Unharmed the Savior passes,
 3  And this rough bit of the way
 3  We must travel, since like Jesus,
 3  Nothing can our purpose stay.
 
 4  Via too, the awful anguish
 4  Of the hours beneath the trees,
 4  Where the host of Satan linger,
 4  Awful hours of anguish these!
 4  Yet we fail not, for God's angels
 4  Minister to us, and say,
 4  "Look, beloved, at the glory,
 4  Conflict is but for a day!"
 
 5  Then the Cross! For via Calvary
 5  Every royal soul must go;
 5  Here we draw the veil, for Jesus
 5  Only can the pathway show;
 5  "If we suffer with Him," listen,
 5  Just a little, little while,
 5  And the memory will have faded
 5  In the glory of His smile!
 
 6  Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,
 6  Knowing that all life has fled;
 6  (Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered
 6  With the men the world calls dead?)
 6  Thence we rise, and live with Jesus,
 6  Throned above the world's mad strife,
 6  Gladly forfeiting forever,
 6  All that worldlings count as life.
 
 7  On we press! And yonder gleaming,
 7  Nearer every day, we see
 7  The great walls of that fair city,
 7  God has built for such as we;
 7  And we catch the tender music
 7  Of the choirs that sing of One
 7  Who once died to have us with Him
 7  In His kingdom, on the throne.
 
 8  Just a few more miles, beloved!
 8  And our feet shall ache no more;
 8  No more sin, and no more sorrow,
 8  Hush thee, Jesus went before;
 8  And I hear Him sweetly whispering,
 8  "Faint not, fear not, still press on,
 8  For it may be ere tomorrow,
 8  The long journey will be done."

 1  The way of the Cross means sacrifice,
 1     As to God you yield your all
 1  To be laid on the altar, the place of death,
 1     Where fire will surely fall.
 
'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
   What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
   To God are you wholly true?
 
 2  As the voice of song and prayer we raise,
 2     How easy to say, We give all;
 2  Till some rougher cross lies just before,
 2     And sterner is duty's call.
 
'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
   What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
   To God are you wholly true?
 
 3  Do you falter then, or, true to death,
 3     Just die on the cross in the way,
 3  Till the fulness of life from the Living One
 3     Is filling you day by day?
 
'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
   What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
   To God are you wholly true?
 
 4  'Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,
 4     One with Jesus crucified;
 4  With the life alone to be lived through you,
 4     Of the Risen, the Glorified.
 
'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
   What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
   To God are you wholly true?

 1  And wouldst thou live on earth as "more than conqu'ror"?
 1  Victorious o'er the worldly life around?
 1  Mark well the pathway that thy Lord hath trodden,
 1  Since here alone the secret can be found.
 
 2  He died, and by His death He dealt the death-blow
 2  To sin and Satan's power for evermore,
 2  And they, who die with Him, shall rise victorious,
 2  And "in this sign" shall triumph more and more.
 
 3  The Cross henceforth their mark of perfect freedom,
 3  What can they lose, who have surrendered all?
 3  What can they fear, who have no reputation?
 3  What shall they shrink from, when His voice doth call?
 
 4  "In this sign," therefore, go henceforth and conquer,
 4  Finding the place of death the gate of life,
 4  "Life more abundant," life in all its fulness,
 4  In the deep calm of God, set free from strife.

 1  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
 1     Through the holy war;
 1  In this sign we conquer
 1     Now and evermore.
 1  Not of man the power,
 1     Not to man the fame;
 1  We are victors only
 1     In our Leader's name.
 
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
   Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
   Now and evermore.
 
 2  Not with pomp and pageant,
 2     Not in earthly pride;
 2  We must fight our battles
 2     Like the Crucified.
 2  Overcome by suff'ring,
 2     Conquer through defeat;
 2  Tried and tested daily
 2     In the furnace heat.
 
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
   Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
   Now and evermore.
 
 3  Kind, yet we are fighting,
 3     Bold, yet humbly meek;
 3  Resting while we're working,
 3     Strong, but ever weak.
 3  Timid, though courageous,
 3     Gaining as we give;
 3  Crucified with Jesus,
 3     Yet, in Him, we live.
 
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
   Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
   Now and evermore.
 
 4  By a cloud encompassed,
 4     Witnesses to prove,
 4  Saints, apostles, prophets,
 4     Precious ones we love;
 4  While "advance!" is sounding,
 4     Mounts the battle thrill.
 4  Cross of Christ! Lead onward
 4     Where the Captain will.
 
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
   Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
   Now and evermore.
 
 5  Marching in the pathway
 5     That the Master trod,
 5  Walks One daily with us
 5     Like the Son of God.
 5  To the end enduring,
 5     Armor ne'er laid down,
 5  Till the Cross leads upward
 5     To the blood-bought crown.
 
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
   Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
   Now and evermore.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16 
 
 1  Let us contemplate the grape vine,
 1     From its life now let us learn,
 1  How its growth is fraught with suff'ring,
 1     Midst environment so stern;
 1  How unlike the untamed flowers
 1     Growing in the wilderness
 1  In a maze of wild confusion,
 1     Making patterns numberless.
 
 2  But the blossoms of the grape vine
 2     Without glory are and small;
 2  Though they do have some expression,
 2     They are hardly seen withal.
 2  But a day since they have flowered
 2     Into fruit the blooms have grown;
 2  Never may they wave corollas
 2     With luxuriant beauty shown.
 
 3  To a post the vine is fastened;
 3     Thus it cannot freely grow;
 3  When its branches are extended,
 3     To the trellis tied they go.
 3  To the stony soil committed,
 3     Drawing thence its food supply;
 3  It can never choose its own way,
 3     Or from difficulty fly.
 
 4  Oh, how beautiful its verdure,
 4     Which in spring spread o'er the field.
 4  From life's energy and fulness
 4     Growth abundant doth it yield.
 4  Till it's full of tender branches
 4     Twining freely everywhere,
 4  Stretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure
 4     Tasting sweetly of the air.
 
 5  But the master of the vineyard
 5     Not in lenience doth abide,
 5  But with knife and pruning scissors
 5     Then would strip it of its pride.
 5  Caring not the vine is tender,
 5     But with deep, precision stroke
 5  All the pretty, excess branches
 5     From the vine are neatly broke.
 
 6  In this time of loss and ruin,
 6     Dare the vine self-pity show?
 6  Nay, it gives itself more fully
 6     To the one who wounds it so,
 6  To the hand that strips its branches,
 6     Till of beauty destitute,
 6  That its life may not be wasted,
 6     But preserved for bearing fruit.
 
 7  Into hard wood slowly hardens
 7     Every stump of bleeding shoot,
 7  Each remaining branch becoming
 7     Clusters of abundant fruit.
 7  Then, beneath the scorching sunshine,
 7     Leaves are dried and from it drop;
 7  Thus the fruit more richly ripens
 7     Till the harvest of the crop.
 
 8  Bowed beneath its fruitful burden,
 8     Loaded branches are brought low -
 8  Labor of its growth thru suff'ring
 8     Many a purposed, cutting blow.
 8  Now its fruit is fully ripened,
 8     Comforted the vine would be;
 8  But the harvest soon is coming,
 8     And its days of comfort flee.
 
 9  Hands will pick and feet will trample
 9     All the riches of the vine,
 9  Till from out the reddened wine-press
 9     Flows a river full of wine.
 9  All the day its flow continues,
 9     Bloody-red, without alloy,
 9  Gushing freely, richly, sweetly,
 9     Filling all the earth with joy.
 
 10  In appearance now the grape vine
 10     Barren is and pitiful;
 10  Having given all, it enters
 10     Into night inscrutable.
 10  No one offers to repay it
 10     For the cheering wine that's drunk,
 10  But 'tis stripped and cut e'en further
 10     To a bare and branchless trunk
 
 11  Yet its wine throughout the winter
 11     Warmth and sweetness ever bears
 11  Unto those in coldness shiv'ring,
 11     Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.
 11  Yet without, alone, the grape vine
 11     Midst the ice and snow doth stand,
 11  Steadfastly its lot enduring,
 11     Though 'tis hard to understand.
 
 12  Winter o'er, the vine prepareth
 12     Fruit again itself to bear;
 12  Budding forth and growing branches,
 12     Beauteous green again to wear;
 12  Never murmuring or complaining
 12     For the winter's sore abuse,
 12  Or for all its loss desiring
 12     Its fresh off'ring to reduce.
 
 13  Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,
 13     As it lifts its arms on high,
 13  Earth's impure, defiled affections
 13     Ne'er the vine may occupy.
 13  Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,
 13     And while love doth prune once more,
 13  Strokes it bears as if it never
 13     Suffered loss and pain before.
 
 14  From the branches of the grape vine
 14     Sap and blood and wine doth flow.
 14  Does the vine, for all it suffered,
 14     Lost, and yielded, poorer grow?
 14  Drunkards of the earth and wanderers,
 14     From it drink and merry make,
 14  From their pleasure and enjoyment
 14     Do they richer thereby wake?
 
 15  Not by gain our life is measured,
 15     But by what we've lost 'tis scored;
 15  'Tis not how much wine is drunken,
 15     But how much has been outpoured.
 15  For the strength of love e'er standeth
 15     In the sacrifice we bear;
 15  He who has the greatest suff'ring
 15     Ever has the most to share.
 
 16  He who treats himself severely
 16     Is the best for God to gain;
 16  He who hurts himself most dearly
 16     Most can comfort those in pain.
 16  He who suffering never beareth
 16     Is but empty "sounding brass";
 16  He who self-like never spareth
 16     Has the joys which all surpass.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  "Wrecked outright on Jesus' breast":
 1  Only "wrecked" souls thus can sing;
 1  Little boats that hug the shore,
 1  Fearing what the storm may bring,
 1  Never find on Jesus' breast,
 1  All that "wrecked" souls mean by rest.
 
 2  "Wrecked outright!" So we lament;
 2  But when storms have done their worst,
 2  Then the soul, surviving all,
 2  In Eternal arms is nursed;
 2  There to find that nought can move
 2  One, embosomed in such love.
 
 3  "Wrecked outright!" No more to own
 3  E'en a craft to sail the sea;
 3  Still a voyager, yet now
 3  Anchored to Infinity;
 3  Nothing left to do but fling
 3  Care aside, and simply cling.
 
 4  "Wrecked outright!" 'Twas purest gain,
 4  Henceforth other craft can see
 4  That the storm may be a boon,
 4  That, however rough the sea,
 4  God Himself doth watchful stand,
 4  For the "wreck' is in His hand.

 1  Death cannot hold the resurrection life,

 2  Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
 2  Though all its force against it may combine;
 2  Death only gives it opportunity
 2  To show the boundless pow'r of life divine.
 
 3  Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
 3  The more interred, the more it multiplies;
 3  All kinds of suff'ring only help it grow
 3  And fruits of life abundant realize.
 
 4  Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
 4  Thru every block and barrier it breaks;
 4  Conqu'ring the pow'r of darkness and of hell,
 4  It swallows death and victory partakes.
 
 5  Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
 5  All of God's fulness it will manifest;
 5  God's righteousness and holiness it yields,
 5  His glorious image by it is expressed.
 
 6  Oh, may I know this resurrection life,
 6  In every kind of death it pow'r outpoured,
 6  In my experience ever realize
 6  This life is nought but Christ my living Lord.

 2  Life out of death - oh, wondrous resurrection!
 2  Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;
 2  Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,
 2  "Not I, but Christ" in me from hour to hour.
 
 3  Life out of death - a pilgrim path and lonely,
 3  Trodden by those who glory in the Cross.
 3  They live in fellowship with "Jesus only,"
 3  And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.
 
 4  Life out of death - blest mission to be ever
 4  Bearing the living water brimming o'er.
 4  With life abundant from the clear, pure river,
 4  Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.

 1  Art thou hung'ring for the fulness

 1  In His word thine answer standeth,

 2  Daily shall reveal more fully

 3  He will never disappoint thee,
 3     Praise Him that the gift is thine;
 3  Then go forth to live each moment
 3     On sufficiency divine.
 
 4  Lord, I come, and simply resting
 4     On Thy faithful, changeless word,
 4  I believe the blood doth cleanse me,
 4     And that Christ is crowned Lord.
 4  Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow
 4     Of Thy life and love through me;
 4  Reaching those who sit in darkness,
 4     Winning priceless souls to Thee.

Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

 2  Through death into life everlasting

Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

 3  Believe Him and all will be well;
 3  Then go to a world that is dying,

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

 1  Oh, trust thyself to Jesus

 1  Then is the hour for pleading
 1     His finished work for thee:

 2  Oh, trust thyself to Jesus

 2  By word or look of anger,
 2     Or thought of bitterness:
 2  Then is the hour for claiming

 2  Then is the time for singing,
 2     He doth deliver me.
 
 3  Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
 3     When daily cares perplex,
 3  And trifles seem so mighty
 3     Thy inner soul to vex:

 3     He makes it calm for me.
 
 4  Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
 4     When thou art wearied sore,
 4  When head or hand refuses
 4     To think or labor more:
 4  Then is the hour for leaning
 4     Upon the Master's breast:
 4  Then is the time for singing,
 4     My Savior gives me rest.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Trust Him when thy wants are many;
 1     Trust Him when thy friends are few;
 1  And the time of swift temptation
 1     Is the time to trust Him too.
 
 2  Trust Him when thy soul is burdened
 2     With the sense of all its sin;
 2  He will speak the word of pardon,
 2     He will make thee clean within.
 
 3  Trust Him for the grace sufficient,
 3     Ever equal to thy need;
 3  Trust Him always for the answer,
 3     When in His dear name you plead.
 
 4  Trust Him for the grace to conquer,
 4     He is able to subdue;
 4  Trust Him for the power for service;
 4     Trust Him for the blessing too.
 
 5  Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,
 5     Trust Him when thy strength is small,
 5  Trust Him when to simply trust Him
 5     Seems the hardest thing of all.
 
 6  Trust Him; His is ever faithful;
 6     Trust Him, for His will is best;
 6  Trust Him, for the heart of Jesus
 6     Is the only place of rest.
 
 7  Trust Him, then, through cloud or sunshine,
 7     All the cares upon Him cast,
 7  Till the storm of life is over,
 7     And the trusting days are past.

 1  Soldier, soldier, fighting in the world's great strife,
 1  On thyself relying, battling for thy life;
 1     Trust thyself no longer,
 1     Trust to Christ - He's stronger;
 1  I can all things, all things do
 1  Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
 
 2  In your daily duty, standing up for right,
 2  Are you sometimes weary - heart not always light?
 2     Doubt your Savior never,
 2     This your motto ever:
 2  I can all things, all things do
 2  Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
 
 3  If your way be weary He will help you through -
 3  Help you in your troubles and your pleasures too;
 3     Say, when Satan's by you;
 3     Say, when all things try you:
 3  I can all things, all things do
 3  Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
 
 4  In a world of trouble, tempted oft to stray,
 4  You need never stumble, Satan cannot stay,
 4     Will but tempt you vainly,
 4     If you tell him plainly:
 4  I can all things, all things do
 4  Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.
 
 5  Jesus' power is boundless, boundless as the sea;
 5  He is always able, able to keep me,
 5     Power bring from my weakness,
 5     Glory from my meekness:
 5  I can all things, all things do
 5  Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

 1  Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne,

Only believe, only believe;

Only believe, only believe;

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  When is the time to trust?
 1  Is it when all is calm,
 1  When waves the victor's palm,
 1  And life is one glad psalm?
 1  Nay! But the time to trust
 1  Is when the waves beat high,
 1  When storm clouds fill the sky,
 1  And pray'r is one long cry.
 
 2  When is the time to trust?
 2  Is it when friends are true?
 2  Is it when comforts woo
 2  In all we say and do?
 2  Nay! But the time to trust
 2  Is when we stand alone,
 2  And summer birds are flown,
 2  And every prop is gone.
 
 3  When is the time to trust?
 3  Is it some future day,
 3  When you have tried your way,
 3  And learned to trust and pray?
 3  Nay! But the time to trust
 3  Is in this moment's need,
 3  Poor, broken, bruised reed,
 3  Poor, troubled soul, make speed!
 
 4  When is the time to trust?
 4  Is it when hopes beat high,
 4  When sunshine gilds the sky
 4  With joy and ecstasy?
 4  Nay! But the time to trust
 4  Is when our joy has fled,
 4  When sorrow bows the head,
 4  And all is cold and dead.

 1  O troubled soul, beneath the rod
 1  Thy Father speaks - be still, be still;
 1  Learn to be silent unto God,
 1  And let Him mold thee to His will.
 
Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.
 
 2  O anxious soul, lay down thy load,
 2  Oh, hear His voice, He speaks to thee,
 2  "Be still and know that I am God,
 2  And cast thy every care on Me."
 
Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.
 
 3  O fearful soul, be still, be still,
 3  Be of good cheer; has He not said,
 3  "I will be with you, fear no ill,
 3  'Tis I, 'tis I, be not afraid"?
 
Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.
 
 4  O praying soul, be still, be still,
 4  He cannot break His plighted word;
 4  Sink down into His blessed will,
 4  And wait in patience on the Lord.
 
Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.
 
 5  O waiting soul, be still, be strong,
 5  And though He tarry, trust and wait;
 5  Doubt not, He will not wait too long,
 5  Fear not, He will not come too late.
 
Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.

 1  "Be all at rest, my soul!" Oh! Blessed secret
 1     Of the true life that glorifies thy Lord;
 1  Not always doth the busiest soul best serve Him,
 1     But he who resteth on His faithful word.
 
 2  "Be all at rest!" for rest is highest service;
 2     To the still heart God doth His secrets tell;
 2  Thus shalt thou learn to wait, and watch, and labor,
 2     Strengthened to bear, since Christ in thee doth dwell.
 
 3  "Be all at rest!" for rest alone becometh
 3     The soul that casts on Him its every care;
 3  "Be all at rest!" so shall thy life proclaim Him
 3     A God who worketh and who heareth prayer.
 
 4  "Be all at rest!" so shalt thou be an answer
 4     To those who question, "Who is God, and where?"
 4  For God is rest, and where He dwells is stillness,
 4     And they who dwell in Him that rest shall share.

 2  Care free and triumphant press on, still to prove
 2  The strength of His arm and the balm of His love.
 
 3  In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay
 3  His strength will be thine till the end of the day.
 3  His arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer;
 3  Then wherefore be anxious, press on without fear.

 1  Master, how shall I bless Thy name
 1     For love so great to me,
 1  For sweet enablings of Thy grace,
 1     So sov'reign, yet so free,
 1  That taught me to obey Thy word,
 1     And cast my care on Thee?
 
 2  No anxious thought upon thy brow
 2     The watching world should see;
 2  No carefulness! O child of God,
 2     For nothing careful be!
 2  But cast thou all thy care on Him
 2     Who always cares for thee.
 
 3  How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,
 3     For this new life so sweet,
 3  For taking all the care I laid
 3     At Thy beloved feet,
 3  Keeping Thy hand upon my heart
 3     To still each anxious beat?
 
 4  I long to praise Thee more, and yet
 4     This is no care to me;
 4  If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs
 4     Then I shall sing to Thee;
 4  And if my silence praise Thee best,
 4     Then silent I will be.
 
 5  Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,
 5     Oh, send me forth to be
 5  Thy messenger to careful hearts,
 5     To bid them taste, and see
 5  How good Thou art to those who cast
 5     All, all their care on Thee.

 1  Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee;
 1     Stranger hands no more impede;
 1  Pass thou on, His strength protects thee,
 1     Strength that has the captive freed.
 
 2  Is the wilderness before thee,
 2     Desert lands where drought abides?
 2  Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,
 2     Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.
 
 3  Light divine surrounds thy going,
 3     God Himself shall mark thy way;
 3  Secret blessings, richly flowing,
 3     Lead to everlasting day.
 
 4  God, thine everlasting portion,
 4     Feeds thee with the Mighty's meat;
 4  Saved from Egypt's hard extortion,
 4     Egypt's food no more to eat.
 
 5  Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
 5     God in secret shall thee keep;
 5  There unfold His hidden treasures,
 5     There His love's exhaustless deep.
 
 6  In the desert God will teach thee
 6     What the God that thou hast found -
 6  Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;
 6     All His grace shall there abound.
 
 7  On to Canaan's rest still wending,
 7     E'en thy wants and woes shall bring
 7  Suited grace from high descending;
 7     Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring.
 
 8  Though thy way be long and dreary,
 8     Eagle strength He'll still renew;
 8  Garments fresh, and feet unweary,
 8     Tell how God hath brought thee through.
 
 9  When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
 9     Love divine thy feet shall bring,
 9  Thou, with shouts of triumph swelling,
 9     Zion's songs in rest shall sing.

 1  Come, let us to the Lord our God
 1     With contrite heart return;
 1  Our God is gracious, nor will leave
 1     The desolate to mourn.
 
 2  His voice commands the tempest forth,
 2     And stills the stormy wave;
 2  And though His arm be strong to smite,
 2     'Tis also strong to save.
 
 3  Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;
 3     The dawn shall bring us light;
 3  God shall appear, and we shall rise
 3     With gladness in His sight.
 
 4  Our heart, if God we seek to know,
 4     Shall know Him, and rejoice;
 4  His coming like the morn shall be,
 4     Like morning songs His voice.
 
 5  As dew upon the tender herb,
 5     Diffusing fragrance round,
 5  As showers that usher in the spring,
 5     And cheer the thirsty ground;
 
 6  So shall His presence bless our souls,
 6     And shed a joyful light;
 6  That hallowed morn shall chase away
 6     The sorrows of the night.

 1  In the heart of Jesus
 1     There is love for you,
 1  Love most pure and tender,

 4  Glorious, bright, and joyous,
 4     Right and peaceful too;
 4  Why then, like a wand'rer,
 4     Roam with weary pace,
 4  If the Church of Jesus

 1  Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;
 1  That, that alone, can be my soul's true rest;
 1  Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,
 1  And stills the tempest of my tossing breast.
 
 2  It is Thy perfect love that casts out fear;
 2  I know the voice that speaks the It is I,
 2  And in these well-known words of heavenly cheer
 2  I hear the joy that bids each sorrow fly.
 
 3  Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon Cross;
 3  Thy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb:
 3  All meaner love is perishable dross,
 3  But this shall light me through time's thickest gloom.
 
 4  It blesses now, and shall forever bless;
 4  It saves me now, and shall for ever save;
 4  It holds me up in days of helplessness,
 4  It bears me safely o'er each swelling wave.
 
 5  'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,
 5  That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;
 5  Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;
 5  Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.
 
 6  More of Thyself, Oh, show me, hour by hour;
 6  More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord;
 6  More of Thyself in all Thy grace and power;
 6  More of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word.

 5  As though no other claimed His love,

 1  God moves in a mysterious way
 1     His wonders to perform:
 1  He plants His footsteps in the sea,
 1     And rides upon the storm.
 
 2  Deep in unfathomable mines
 2     Of never-failing skill,
 2  He treasures up His bright designs,
 2     And works His sovereign will.
 
 3  Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
 3     The clouds ye so much dread
 3  Are big with mercy, and shall break
 3     In blessings on your head.
 
 4  Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
 4     But trust Him for His grace;
 4  Behind a frowning providence
 4     He hides a smiling face.
 
 5  His purpose will ripen fast,
 5     Unfolding every hour:
 5  The bud may have a bitter taste,
 5     But sweet will be the flower.
 
 6  Blind unbelief is sure to err,
 6     And scan His work in vain;
 6  God is His own Interpreter,
 6     And He will make it plain.

 1  All thy griefs by Him are ordered,
 1     Needful is each one for thee;
 1  All thy tears by Him are counted,
 1     One too much there cannot be;
 1  And if while they fall so quickly
 1     Thou canst own His way is right,
 1  Then each bitter tear of anguish
 1     Precious is in Jesus' sight.
 
 2  Far too well thy Savior loves thee
 2     To allow thy life to be
 2  One long, calm, unbroken summer -
 2     One unruffled, stormless sea;
 2  He would have thee fondly nestling
 2     Closer to His loving breast,
 2  He would have that day seem brighter
 2     When alone is perfect rest.

 1  Art thou sunk in depths of sorrow
 1  Where no arm can reach so low?
 1  There is One whose arms almighty
 1  Reach beyond thy deepest woe.
 1  God th' Eternal is thy refuge,
 1  Let it still thy wild alarms;
 1  Underneath thy deepest sorrow,
 1  Are the everlasting arms.
 
Underneath thee, underneath thee,
Are the everlasting arms,
Everlasting, everlasting,
Are the everlasting arms.
 
 2  Other arms grow faint and weary,
 2  These can never faint, nor fail;
 2  Others reach our mounts of blessing,
 2  These our lowest loneliest vale.
 2  O that all might know His friendship!
 2  O that all might see His charms!
 2  O that all might have beneath them
 2  Jesus' everlasting arms.
 
Underneath thee, underneath thee,
Are the everlasting arms,
Everlasting, everlasting,
Are the everlasting arms.
 
 3  Underneath us, O how easy;
 3  We have not to mount on high,
 3  But to sink into His fulness,
 3  And in trustful weakness lie.
 3  And we find our humbling failures
 3  Save us from the strength that harms!
 3  We may fail, but underneath us
 3  Are the everlasting arms.
 
Underneath thee, underneath thee,
Are the everlasting arms,
Everlasting, everlasting,
Are the everlasting arms.
 
 4  Arms of Jesus! Fold me closer,
 4  To Thy strong and loving breast,
 4  Till my spirit on Thy bosom
 4  Finds its everlasting rest;
 4  And when time's last sands are sinking,
 4  Shield my heart from all alarms,
 4  Softly whispering, "Underneath thee,
 4  Are the everlasting arms."
 
Underneath thee, underneath thee,
Are the everlasting arms,
Everlasting, everlasting,
Are the everlasting arms.

 3     Break on the golden shore.
 
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
   Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o'ershaded,
   Sweetly my soul doth rest.

 1  "All in His hands" - what confidence it brings

 1  In His strong hands, and patiently unfolds
 1  Th' eternal purpose of His sovereign Will -
 1  That all things shall His grace and glory fill.
 
 2  "All in His hands"? Then life with purpose moves

 2  Or Satan cannot mar or foil the plan
 2  Which God ordained - to manifest His Son

 1  God holds the key to all unknown,

 1        I might be sad.
 
 2  What if tomorrow's cares were here,
 2        Without its rest?
 2  I'd rather He unlocked the day,
 2  And, as the hours swing open, say,
 2        My will is best.
 
 3  The very dimness of my sight
 3        Makes me secure;
 3  For, groping in my misty way,
 3  I feel His hand; I hear Him say,
 3        My help is sure.
 
 4  I cannot read His future plans;
 4        But this I know:
 4  I have the smiling of His face,
 4  And all the refuge of His grace
 4        While here below.
 
 5  Enough; this covers all my wants;
 5        And so I rest;

 1  Through the clouds of midnight,
 1  This bright promise shone,
 1  "I will never leave thee,

No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,

No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.

 2  Jesus, heaven's sunshine,
 2  Never will leave me alone.
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.
 
 3  Steps unseen before me,
 3  Hidden dangers near;
 3  Nearer still my Savior,
 3  Whispering, "Be of cheer";
 3  Joys, like birds of springtime,
 3  To my heart have flown,
 3  Singing all so sweetly,
 3  "He will not leave me alone."
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.

 1        My hope, my salvation, my all!

 3  Oh, why should I wander, an alien from Thee,

 1  I've seen the lightning flashing,
 1     And heard the thunder roll;
 1  I've felt sin's breakers dashing,
 1     Trying to conquer my soul;
 1  I've heard the voice of Jesus,
 1     Telling me still to fight on;
 1  He promised never to leave me,
 1     Never to leave me alone.
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.
 
 2  The world's fierce winds are blowing,
 2     Temptations are sharp and keen;
 2  I feel a peace in knowing
 2     My Savior stands between;
 2  He stands to shield me from danger,
 2     When earthly friends are gone,
 2  He promised never to leave me,
 2     Never to leave me alone.
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.
 
 3  When in affliction's valley,
 3     I'm treading the road of care,
 3  My Savior helps me to carry
 3     My cross when heavy to bear;
 3  My feet entangled with briars,
 3     Ready to cast me down;
 3  My Savior whispered His promise,
 3     Never to leave me alone.
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.
 
 4  He died for me on the mountain,
 4     For me they pierced His side,
 4  For me He opened that fountain,
 4     The crimson, cleaning tide;
 4  For me He waiteth in glory,
 4     Seated upon His throne;
 4  He promised never to leave me,
 4     Never to leave me alone.
 
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone;
No, never alone,
   No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
   Never to leave me alone.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Hark! A voice from heav'n proclaiming,
 1        "It is done."
 1  Faith repeats the echo claiming,
 1        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."
 
 2  Hear the bleeding Savior crying,
 2        "It is done."
 2  Claim His finished work, replying,
 2        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."
 
 3  Yield thyself in consecration,
 3        "It is done."
 3  Take the Lord for full salvation,
 3        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."
 
 4  Claim the promise of His healing,
 4        "It is done."
 4  Trust without a sign or feeling,
 4        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."
 
 5  Say of every promised blessing,
 5        "It is done."
 5  Rest upon His word, confessing,
 5        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."
 
 6  This the secret of receiving,
 6        "It is done."
 6  Take Him at His word believing,
 6        "It is done."
 
Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."

 1  Hark! The voice of love and mercy

 1  See, it rends the rocks asunder,
 1     Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
 1  "It is finished!" "It is finished!"
 1     Hear the dying Savior cry.
 
 2  "It is finished!" Oh, what pleasure

 3  Finished all that God had promised;

 4     Glory to the bleeding Lamb!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n
 1     For our help in the hour of need:
 1  Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,
 1     To be dead and dead indeed.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.
 
 2  There's another word that the Lord has giv'n,
 2     In the very same verse we read,
 2  Let us reckon ourselves as alive in Him,
 2     As alive and alive indeed.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.
 
 3  While we trust in feeling or inward frames
 3     We shall always be tossed about,
 3  Let us anchor fast to the Word of God,
 3     And reckon away our doubt.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.
 
 4  As the mariner, when the skies are dim,
 4     Sails on by his compass true;
 4  So our faith would cling to the promise firm,
 4     And reckon the journey through.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.
 
 5  O how sweet it is to be anchored fast
 5     To a hope that can never fail;
 5  Let us reckon on with a firmer trust,
 5     Till we anchor within the veil.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.
 
 6  You may claim the promise from every pain,
 6     You may know His power to heal;
 6  But your faith must rest in His word alone,
 6     And reckon, rather than feel.
 
Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
   And He will make it real.

 1  He faileth not, for He is God;
 1  He faileth not, His grace how good!
 1  He faileth not, His Word is clear;
 1  If we have God, whom need we fear?
 
 2  The highest mount, He can make plain;
 2  The wildest flood, He can restrain!
 2  God of Impossibilities!
 2  Poor puny man, now learn His ways.
 
 3  The axe did swim on Jordan's wave!
 3  Our God the Red Sea's waters clave!
 3  He stopped the sun! Made long the day!
 3  This is the God to whom we pray.
 
 4  He bars the sea with feeble sand!
 4  The proud waves bow at His command!
 4  If God is thine, what more your need?
 4  Can He not work for you indeed?
 
 5  Our God is love; your needs are known;
 5  His promises He'll fully own.
 5  Our gracious God bows down His ear
 5  The feeblest, weakest cry to hear.
 
 6  Our God is light, and never yet,
 6  One promise did He e'er forget.
 6  His promises in Christ the Son
 6  Are fully pledged, Yea and Amen.
 
 7  Our faithful God, faith cannot break,
 7  Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!
 7  Who ask in faith, He'll not deny;
 7  His Word is sure, He must reply.
 
 8  He faileth not, let all men hear;
 8  He faileth not, His Word is clear.
 8  He faileth not, His grace how good;
 8  He faileth not, for He is God!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
 1  Too deeply for mirth or song,
 1     As the burdens press,
 1     And the cares distress,
 1  And the way grows weary and long?
 
O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
   When the days are weary,
   The long night dreary,
I know my Savior cares.
 
 2  Does Jesus care when my way is dark
 2  With a nameless dread and fear?
 2     As the daylight fades
 2     Into deep night shades,
 2  Does He care enough to be near?
 
O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
   When the days are weary,
   The long night dreary,
I know my Savior cares.
 
 3  Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed
 3  To resist some temptation strong;
 3     When for my deep grief
 3     There is no relief,
 3  Though my tear flow all the night long?
 
O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
   When the days are weary,
   The long night dreary,
I know my Savior cares.
 
 4  Does Jesus care when I've said "goodbye"
 4  To the dearest on earth to me,
 4     And my sad heart aches
 4     Till it nearly breaks,
 4  Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
 
O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
   When the days are weary,
   The long night dreary,
I know my Savior cares.

 1  Take Him this moment at His word,
 1     And let Him do His part.
 
 2  The need is deep, the care is great,
 2     The burden hard to bear;
 2  Roll it on Him with all its weight,
 2     And leave it resting there.
 
 3  This heavy thing, it is His gift,
 3     His portion, thee to bless;
 3  Give it Him back; what He shall lift
 3     No more on thee shall press.
 
 4  Cast all thy care, and not a part,
 4     The great things and the small;
 4  The Lord's all-loving, mighty heart
 4     Has room and thought for all.
 
 5  Yes, He will ponder every care,
 5     Consider each detail;
 5  Thyself, thy burden, let Him bear;
 5     He will not, cannot, fail.

 1  Weary pilgrim on life's pathway -
 1     Struggling on beneath thy load -
 1  Hear these words of consolation,
 1     "Cast thy burden on the Lord."
 
Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
   sustain and comfort thee -
Cast thy burden on the Lord.
 
 2  Are thy tired feet unsteady?
 2     Does thy lamp no light afford?
 2  Is thy cross too great and heavy?
 2     "Cast thy burden on the Lord."
 
Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
   sustain and comfort thee -
Cast thy burden on the Lord.
 
 3  Are the ties of friendship severed?
 3     Hushed the voices fondly heard?
 3  Breaks thy heart with weight of anguish?
 3     "Cast thy burden on the Lord."
 
Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
   sustain and comfort thee -
Cast thy burden on the Lord.
 
 4  Does thy heart with faintness falter?
 4     Does thy mind forget His word?
 4  Does thy strength succumb to weakness?
 4     "Cast thy burden on the Lord."
 
Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
   sustain and comfort thee -
Cast thy burden on the Lord.
 
 5  He will hold thee up from falling;
 5     He will guide thy steps aright;
 5  He will strengthen each endeavor;
 5     He will keep thee by His might.
 
Cast thy burden on the Lord!
Cast thy burden on the Lord,
And He will strengthen thee,
   sustain and comfort thee -
Cast thy burden on the Lord.

 1  'Tis now in part I know His grace;
 1  I catch sweet glimpses of His face,
 1  But in that better world of His,
 1  I shall behold Him as He is.
 
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne;
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne.
 
 2  'Tis now in part I know His love;
 2  Bright sunbeams shine from skies above;
 2  But glories more exceeding far,
 2  Shall rise beyond life's evening star.
 
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne;
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne.
 
 3  'Tis now in part I understand
 3  The leadings of my Father's hand;
 3  But I shall own His ways were right,
 3  When welcomed to His presence bright.
 
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne;
Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne.
 
 4  'Tis now in part, but O how sweet
 4  To rest by faith at His dear feet;
 4  Though now we see as through a glass,
 4  The veil will lift, the shadows pass.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Precious promise God doth give thee,
 1     Thou, the weary passerby,
 1  On the way from earth to glory:
 1     "I will guide thee with Mine eye."
 
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye;
On the way from earth to glory,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye.
 
 2  When temptations fierce assail thee,
 2     When thy trusted helpers fly,
 2  Let this promise ring within thee,
 2     "I will guide thee with Mine eye."
 
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye;
On the way from earth to glory,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye.
 
 3  When thy secret hopes have perished
 3     In the grave of years gone by,
 3  Let this promise still be cherished,
 3     "I will guide thee with Mine eye."
 
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye;
On the way from earth to glory,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye.
 
 4  When the shades of life are falling,
 4     And the hour has come to die,
 4  Hear thy faithful Pilot calling,
 4     "I will guide thee with Mine eye."
 
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye;
On the way from earth to glory,
   I will guide thee with Mine eye.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Though troubles assail,
 1  And dangers affright;
 1  Though friends should all fail,
 1  And foes all unite,
 1  Yet one thing secures us,
 1  Whatever betide:
 1  The Scripture assures us,
 1  "The Lord will provide."
 
 2  The birds, without barn
 2  Or storehouse, are fed;
 2  From them let us learn
 2  To trust for our bread;
 2  His saints what is fitting
 2  Shall ne'er be denied,
 2  So long as 'tis written,
 2  "The Lord will provide."
 
 3  His call we obey,
 3  Like Abram of old,
 3  Not knowing our way,
 3  But faith makes us bold;
 3  For though we are strangers,
 3  We have a good Guide;
 3  And trust in all dangers:
 3  "The Lord will provide."
 
 4  When Satan appears
 4  To stop up our path,
 4  And fills us with fears,
 4  We triumph by faith;
 4  He cannot take from us,
 4  Though oft he has tried,
 4  The heart-cheering promise,
 4  "The Lord will provide."
 
 5  He tells us we're weak,
 5  Our hope is in vain;
 5  The good that we seek
 5  We ne'er shall obtain;
 5  But when such suggestions
 5  Our faith thus have tried,
 5  This answers all questions,
 5  "The Lord will provide."
 
 6  No strength of our own,
 6  Nor goodness we claim;
 6  Our trust is all thrown
 6  On Jesus' dear name.
 6  In this our strong tower
 6  For safety we hide;
 6  The Lord is our power,
 6  "The Lord will provide."
 
 7  When life sinks apace,
 7  And death is in view,
 7  The word of His grace
 7  Shall comfort us through;
 7  Not fearing or doubting,
 7  With Christ on our side,
 7  We hope to die shouting,
 7  "The Lord will provide."

 1  In some way or other the Lord will provide:
 1  It may not be my way, it may not be thy way;
 1  And yet in His own way, "the Lord will provide."
 
Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.
 
 2  At some time or other the Lord will provide:
 2  It may not be my time, it may not be thy time;
 2  And yet in His own time, "the Lord will provide."
 
Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.
 
 3  Despond then no longer; the Lord will provide:
 3  And this be the token - no word He hath spoken
 3  Was ever yet broken: "The Lord will provide."
 
Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.
 
 4  March on then right boldly: the sea shall divide;
 4  The pathway made glorious, with shoutings victorious,
 4  We'll join in the chorus, "The Lord will provide."
 
Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.

 1  Sometimes a light surprises
 1     The Christian while he sings;
 1  It is the Lord who rises
 1     With healing in His wings;
 1  When comforts are declining,
 1     He grants the soul again
 1  A season of clear shining,
 1     To cheer it after rain.
 
 2  In holy contemplation
 2     We sweetly then pursue
 2  The theme of God's salvation,
 2     And find it ever new;
 2  Set free from present sorrow,
 2     We cheerfully can say -
 2  E'en let the unknown morrow
 2     Bring with it what it may.
 
 3  It can bring with it nothing,
 3     But He will bear us through;
 3  Who gives the lilies clothing,
 3     Will clothe His people too:
 3  Beneath the spreading heavens
 3     No creature but is fed;
 3  And He, who feeds the ravens,
 3     Will give His children bread.
 
 4  Though vine nor fig tree neither
 4     Their wonted fruit shall bear;
 4  Though all the fields should wither
 4     Nor flocks nor herds be there;
 4  Yet God the same abiding,
 4     His praise shall tune my voice,
 4  For, while in Him confiding,
 4     I cannot but rejoice.

 1  When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,
 1  When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
 1  Count your many blessing name them one by one,
 1  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.
 
Count your blessings, name them one by one;
Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.
 
 2  Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
 2  Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
 2  Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
 2  And you will be singing as the days go by.
 
Count your blessings, name them one by one;
Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.
 
 3  When you look at others with their lands and gold,
 3  Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.
 3  Count your many blessings, money cannot buy
 3  Your reward in heaven, nor your Lord on high.
 
Count your blessings, name them one by one;
Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.
 
 4  So amid the conflict, whether great or small,
 4  Do not be discouraged, God is over all;
 4  Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
 4  Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.
 
Count your blessings, name them one by one;
Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

 1  Fresh as the dew of the morning,
 1     Bringing a sweet rest unheard,
 1  Christ, in the gentle anointing,
 1     Whispers His comforting word:
 1  Stand till the trial is over,
 1     Stand till the tempest is gone,
 1  Stand for the glory of Jesus,
 1     Stand till the kingdom is won.
 
Lord of all hope, O how
   sweet is Thy voice,
Making my heart in Thy
   presence rejoice.
 
 2  If in the test of my trouble,
 2     Faint be my spirit and heart,
 2  Faint, with the star of hope glimm'ring,
 2     Shall all be taken apart,
 2  May then Thy faith with Thy life-pow'r
 2     Over me hold its full sway
 2  That all Thy riches of glory
 2     Now I may share and for aye.
 
Lord of all hope, O how
   sweet is Thy voice,
Making my heart in Thy
   presence rejoice.
 
 3  Lord, as the morning sun dawning,
 3     Chase all my darkness away,
 3  And with Thy kind wings of healing
 3     Turn all my night into day.
 3  Come Thou, O come, Lord of comfort,
 3     Come to my sad, weary heart,
 3  Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,
 3     Never, O never depart.
 
Lord of all hope, O how
   sweet is Thy voice,
Making my heart in Thy
   presence rejoice.

 1  Jesus triumphant when the storm-clouds break,

 1  When biting blasts lay earthly projects low,
 1  And one by one the fondest treasures go.
 
 2  Jesus triumphant, through the fleeting years;
 2  Jesus triumphant, spite of blinding tears;
 2  High over all, to hear Thy loving voice,
 2  Which bids the heart look upward and rejoice.
 
 3  Jesus triumphant, when in work for Thee,
 3  Sad and disheartened, no results we see;
 3  When gathered force of evil seems to win,
 3  And work for Christ seems lost in work of sin.
 
 4  Jesus triumphant all along the line;
 4  Triumphant Savior, all Thy triumph mine;
 4  For since I am a partner in Thy love,
 4  My life on earth is lived through Thee above.
 
 5  Jesus triumphant when the spirit wings
 5  Onward and upward to the King of kings;
 5  And through the last great triumph of Thy grace
 5  Triumphant saints shall see Thee face to face.

 1  I know not what awaits me,
 1     God kindly veils my eyes,
 1  And o'er each step of my onward way
 1     He makes new scenes to rise;
 1  And every joy He sends me comes
 1     A sweet and glad surprise.
 
Where He may lead I'll follow,
   My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."
 
 2  One step I see before me,
 2     'Tis all I need to see,
 2  The light of heaven more brightly shines
 2     When earth's illusions flee;
 2  And sweetly through the silence comes,
 2     His loving, "Trust in Me!"
 
Where He may lead I'll follow,
   My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."
 
 3  Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
 3     'Tis blessed not to know;
 3  He holds me with His own right hand,
 3     And will not let me go,
 3  And lulls my troubled soul to rest
 3     In Him who loves me so.
 
Where He may lead I'll follow,
   My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."
 
 4  So on I go not knowing;
 4     I would not if might;
 4  I'd rather walk in the dark with God
 4     Than go alone in the light;
 4  I'd rather walk by faith with Him
 4     Than go alone by sight.
 
Where He may lead I'll follow,
   My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
And every hour in perfect peace,
   I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."

 1  Be still, my heart! These anxious cares
 1  To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;
 1  They cast dishonor on the Lord,
 1  And contradict His gracious word.
 
 2  Brought safely by His hand thus far,
 2  Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
 2  How canst thou want if He provide,
 2  Or lose thy way with such a Guide?
 
 3  When first before His mercy-seat
 3  Thou didst to Him thine all commit;
 3  He gave thee warrant from that hour
 3  To trust His wisdom, love, and power.
 
 4  Did ever trouble yet befall,
 4  And He refuse to hear thy call?
 4  And has He not His promise passed,
 4  That thou shalt overcome at last?
 
 5  He who has helped me hitherto
 5  Will help me all my journey through,
 5  And give me daily cause to raise
 5  New Ebenezers to His praise.
 
 5  Though rough and thorny be the road,
 5  It leads thee on, apace, to God;
 5  Then count thy present trials small,
 5  For God will make amends for all.

 1  Day by day, and with each passing moment,
 1  Strength I find to meet my trials here;
 1  Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
 1  I've no cause for worry or for fear.
 1  He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
 1  Gives unto each day what He deems best,
 1  Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure,
 1  Mingling toil with peace and rest.
 
 2  Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
 2  With a special mercy for each hour;
 2  All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
 2  He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.
 2  The protection of His child and treasure
 2  Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
 2  "As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
 2  This the pledge to me He made.
 
 3  Help me then, in every tribulation,
 3  So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
 3  That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
 3  Offered me within Thy holy Word.
 3  Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
 3  E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
 3  One by one, the days, the moments fleeting.
 3  Till with Christ the Lord I stand.

 1  Not now, but in the coming years,
 1  It may be when with Christ we stand,
 1  We'll read the meaning of our tears,
 1  And there, sometime, we'll understand.
 
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.
 
 2  We'll catch the broken thread again,
 2  And finish what we here began;
 2  God will the mysteries explain,
 2  And then, ah, then, we'll understand.
 
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.
 
 3  We'll know why clouds instead of sun
 3  Were over many a cherished plan;
 3  Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
 3  'Tis then, sometime, we'll understand.
 
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.
 
 4  Why what we long for most of all,
 4  Eludes so oft our eager hand;
 4  Why hopes are crushed and castles fall,
 4  Till then, sometime, we'll understand.
 
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.
 
 5  God knows the way, He holds the key,
 5  He guides us with unerring hand;
 5  Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see;
 5  Yes, then, 'tis then, we'll understand.
 
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.

 1  Begone, unbelief,
 1     My Savior is near,
 1  And for my relief
 1     Will surely appear;
 1  By prayer let me wrestle,
 1     And He will perform;
 1  With Christ in the vessel,
 1     I smile at the storm.
 
 2  Though dark be my way,
 2     Since He is my Guide,
 2  'Tis mine to obey,
 2     'Tis His to provide;
 2  Though cisterns be broken,
 2     And creatures all fail,
 2  The word He hath spoken
 2     Shall surely prevail.
 
 3  His love, in time past,
 3     Forbids me to think
 3  He'll leave me at last
 3     In trouble to sink:
 3  Each sweet Ebenezer
 3     I have in review
 3  Confirms His good pleasure
 3     To help me quite through.
 
 4  Why should I complain
 4     Of want or distress,
 4  Temptation or pain?
 4     He told me no less;
 4  The heirs of salvation,
 4     I know from His Word,
 4  Through much tribulation
 4     Must follow their Lord.
 
 5  How bitter that cup
 5     No heart can conceive,
 5  Which He drank quite up,
 5     That sinners might live!
 5  His way was much rougher
 5     And darker than mine;
 5  Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
 5     And shall I repine?
 
 6  Since all that I meet
 6     Shall work for my good,
 6  The bitter is sweet,
 6     The medicine, food;
 6  Though painful at present,
 6     'Twill cease before long,
 6  And then, oh, how pleasant
 6     The conqueror's song!

 1  O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
 1  Though all things around us be trying,
 1  Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,
 1  It's better to sing than be sighing.
 
Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
It is better to sing than be sighing:
It is better to live than be dying;
So let us rejoice evermore.
 
 2  O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
 2  When the darts of the tempter are flying,
 2  For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,
 2  Our singing much more than our sighing.
 
Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
It is better to sing than be sighing:
It is better to live than be dying;
So let us rejoice evermore.
 
 3  O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
 3  When sickness upon us is stealing,
 3  No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
 3  For joy is the fountain of healing.
 
Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
It is better to sing than be sighing:
It is better to live than be dying;
So let us rejoice evermore.

 1  Like a river, glorious

Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
Hearts are fully blest;

Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
Hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.
 
 3  Every joy or trial
 3     Falleth from above,

Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
Hearts are fully blest;

 1  God hath not promised skies always blue,
 1  Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;
 1  God hath not promised sun without rain,
 1  Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.
 
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.
 
 2  God hath not promised we shall not know
 2  Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
 2  He hath not told us we shall not bear
 2  Many a burden, many a care.
 
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.
 
 3  God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
 3  Swift, easy travel, needing not guide;
 3  Never a mountain, rocky and steep,
 3  Never a river, turbid and deep.
 
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above,
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  I'll sing of the wonderful promise
 1  That Jesus has given to me;
 1  "My strength is made perfect in weakness,
 1  My grace is sufficient for thee."
 1  And lest my poor heart should forget it,
 1  Or ever forgetful should be,
 1  He still keeps repeating the promise,
 1  My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
Yes, over and over and over,
My Savior keeps saying to me;
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
 2  His grace is sufficient to save me,
 2  And cleanse me from guilt and from sin;
 2  Sufficient to sanctify wholly,
 2  And give me His Spirit within.
 2  His grace is sufficient for trials,
 2  No matter how hard they may be,
 2  This promise stands over against them,
 2  My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
Yes, over and over and over,
My Savior keeps saying to me;
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
 3  His grace is sufficient for sickness,
 3  Sustaining and making me whole;
 3  His grace is sufficient when sorrows
 3  Like billows roll over the soul.
 3  His grace is sufficient for service,
 3  It sets us from selfishness free,
 3  And sends us to tell the tried ones,
 3  His grace is sufficient for thee.
 
Yes, over and over and over,
My Savior keeps saying to me;
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
 4  His grace is sufficient to live by,
 4  And should we be summoned to die
 4  'Twill light up the valley of shadows,
 4  And bear us away to Him nigh.
 4  Or when we shall stand in His vict'ry,
 4  And Christ in His glory shall see,
 4  We'll fall at His footstool confessing,
 4  Thy grace was sufficient for me.
 
Yes, over and over and over,
My Savior keeps saying to me;
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
 5  It is not our grace that's sufficient,
 5  But His grace, it ever must be:
 5  Our graces are transient and changing;
 5  His grace is unfailing as He.
 5  And so I am ever repeating
 5  His wonderful promise to me,
 5  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
 5  My grace is sufficient for thee.
 
Yes, over and over and over,
My Savior keeps saying to me;
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.

 1  The cross that He gave may be heavy,
 1     But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
 1  The storm that I feared may surround me,
 1     But it ne'er excludes His face.
 
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
   I am satisfied to know
   That with Jesus here below,
   I can conquer every foe.
 
 2  The thorns in my path are not sharper
 2     Than composed His crown for me;
 2  The cup that I drink not more bitter
 2     Than He drank at Gethsemane.
 
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
   I am satisfied to know
   That with Jesus here below,
   I can conquer every foe.
 
 3  The light of His love shineth brighter,
 3     As it falls on paths of woe;
 3  The toil of my work groweth lighter,
 3     As I stoop to raise the low.
 
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
   I am satisfied to know
   That with Jesus here below,
   I can conquer every foe.
 
 4  His will I have joy in fulfilling,
 4     As I'm walking in His sight;
 4  My trials more blessings are bringing,
 4     Christ in them is my delight.
 
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
   I am satisfied to know
   That with Jesus here below,
   I can conquer every foe.

 1  He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,
 1  He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,
 1  To added affliction He addeth His mercy,
 1  To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.
 
 2  When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
 2  When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,
 2  When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
 2  Our Father's full giving is only begun.
 
 3  His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
 3  His power no boundary known unto men,
 3  For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
 3  He giveth and giveth and giveth again.

 1     A little bird I am,
 1     Shut from the fields of air,
 1  And in my cage I sit and sing
 1     To Him who placed me there;
 1  Well pleased a prisoner to be,
 1  Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.
 
 2     Nought have I else to do,
 2     I sing the whole day long;
 2  And He whom most I love to please
 2     Doth listen to my song;
 2  He caught and bound my wandering wing;
 2  But still He bends to hear me sing.
 
 3     Thou hast an ear to hear
 3     A heart to love and bless;
 3  And though my notes were e'er so rude,
 3     Thou wouldst not hear the less;
 3  Because Thou knowest as they fall,
 3  That love, sweet love, inspires them all.
 
 4     My cage confines me round;
 4     Abroad I cannot fly;
 4  But though my wing is closely bound,
 4     My heart's at liberty;
 4  For prison walls cannot control
 4  The flight, the freedom of the soul.
 
 5     O it is good to soar
 5     These bolts and bars above!
 5  To Him whose purpose I adore,
 5     Whose providence I love;
 5  And in Thy mighty will to find
 5  The joy, the freedom of the mind.

 1  Strong are the walls around me,

 1  My very dungeon walls are dear,
 1  Because the God I love is here.

 3  I ask no more, in good or ill,
 3  But union with Thy holy will.
 
 4  'Tis that which make me treasure,
 4     'Tis that which brings me gain;

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Long plunged in sorrow, I resign
 1  My soul to that dear hand of Thine,
 1     Without reserve or fear;
 1  That hand shall wipe my streaming eyes,
 1  Or into smiles of glad surprise
 1     Transform the falling tear.
 
 2  Adieu! Ye vain delights of earth;
 2  Insipid sports, and childish mirth,
 2     I taste no sweets in you;
 2  Unknown delights are in the cross,
 2  All joy beside to me is dross;
 2     And Jesus thought so too.
 
 3  The Cross! O ravishment and bliss -
 3  How grateful e'en its anguish is;
 3     Its bitterness how sweet!
 3  There every sense, and all the mind,
 3  In all her faculties refined,
 3     Taste happiness complete.
 
 4  Self-love no grace in sorrow sees,
 4  Consults her own peculiar ease:
 4     'Tis all the bliss she knows;
 4  But nobler aims true love employ.
 4  In self-denial is her joy,
 4     In suffering her repose.
 
 5  Thy choice and mine shall be the same,
 5  Inspirer of that holy flame
 5     Which must forever blaze!
 5  To take the cross and follow Thee,
 5  Where love and duty lead, shall be
 5     My portion and my praise.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  I have been through the valley of sorrow and weeping,
 1        The valley of trouble and pain;
 1  But the "God of all comfort," the "God of all comfort,"
 1        Was with me to hold and sustain.
 
 2  As the earth needs the clouds and the rain with the sunshine,
 2        Our souls need both sorrow and joy,
 2  So He places us oft in the fire of affliction
 2        The dross from the gold to destroy.
 
 3  When He leads thru the valleys of trouble and sorrow,
 3        His mercy and love there we trace;
 3  For the trials and sorrows He sends us in wisdom
 3        Are part of His lessons in grace.
 
 4  Yet how often we shrink from the purging and pruning,
 4        Forgetting the Husbandman knows
 4  That the deeper and closer the cutting and paring,
 4        The richer the cluster that grows.
 
 5  O how well does He know that afflictions are needed;
 5        He has a wise purpose in view,
 5  And within the dark valley He whispers to comfort,
 5        "Hereafter thou'lt know what I do."
 
 6  As we travel the pathway thru life's shadowed valleys,
 6        Fresh springs of His love ever rise;
 6  And we learn that our troubles, our sorrows and losses,
 6        Are blessings just sent in disguise.
 
 7  So we'll follow Him faithfully where'er He leadeth,
 7        The pathway be dreary or bright;
 7  For we've proved that our God is the "God of all comfort,"
 7        The God who gives songs in the night.

 1  Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;
 1  Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;
 1  Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul,
 1  Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.
 
God is my hope and God is my joy;
He is the resurrection life I enjoy.
 
 2  Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;
 2  Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;
 2  Pressed into knowing none to help but God,
 2  Pressed into loving both the staff and the rod.
 
God is my hope and God is my joy;
He is the resurrection life I enjoy.
 
 3  Pressed into liberty where nothing clings,
 3  Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;
 3  Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord,
 3  Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.
 
God is my hope and God is my joy;
He is the resurrection life I enjoy.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  Why should I fear the darkest hour,
 1  Or tremble at the tempter's power?
 1  Jesus vouchsafes to be my tower.
 
 2  Though hot the fight, why quit the field?
 2  Why must I either fly or yield,
 2  Since Jesus is my mighty shield?
 
 3  When creature comforts fade and die,
 3  Worldlings may weep, but why should I?
 3  Jesus still lives, and still is nigh.
 
 4  Though all the flocks and herds were dead,
 4  My soul a famine need not dread,
 4  For Jesus is my living bread.
 
 5  I know not what may soon betide,
 5  Or how my wants shall be supplied;
 5  But Jesus knows, and will provide.
 
 6  Though sin would fill me with distress,
 6  The throne of grace I dare address,
 6  For Jesus is my righteousness.
 
 7  Though faint my prayers and cold my love,
 7  My steadfast hope shall not remove,
 7  While Jesus intercedes above.
 
 8  Against me earth and hell combine;
 8  But on my side is power divine;
 8  Jesus is all, and He is mine!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  My Father is rich in houses and lands,
 1  He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
 1  Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
 1  His coffers are full, He has riches untold.
 
I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I'm a child of the King.
 
 2  My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
 2  Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them.
 2  But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
 2  That we may be His when He comes by and by.
 
I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I'm a child of the King.
 
 3  I once was an out-cast stranger on earth,
 3  A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth;
 3  But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
 3  An heir of salvation, the kingdom and crown.
 
I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I'm a child of the King.
 
 4  Though poor on this earth, oh, why should I care?
 4  Since glorious things for me God doth prepare;
 4  Though trials abound, yet, still I may sing:
 4  All glory to God, I'm a child of the King.
 
I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I'm a child of the King.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  In Eden's garden fair we see
 1  That God before two trees placed man,
 1  The trees of life, and knowledge too,
 1  Which for the Lord and Satan stand.
 
 2  The tree of life the center is
 2  Of God's eternal, perfect plan,
 2  Denoting God in Christ as life
 2  To be received as all by man.
 
 3  The tree of knowledge standing there,
 3  Bespeaks a sure and warning voice:
 3  Outside of God there is a source
 3  Of death to all who make this choice.
 
 4  If man would eat the tree of life,
 4  Then God as life he will receive,
 4  And be transformed to precious stones,
 4  God's will and purpose to achieve.
 
 5  If man the tree of knowledge takes,
 5  Then Satan enters into man
 5  As sin, which brings him into death,
 5  That he may not fulfill God's plan.
 
 6  This signifies that only God
 6  Is our full source of life and breath;
 6  To touch ought else is but to touch
 6  The source of knowledge and of death.
 
 7  For knowledge only bringeth death,
 7  Though evil or though good it seem;
 7  For any thing apart from God,
 7  Is but the fruit of Satan's scheme.
 
 8  Not only evil, but the good
 8  Is contradictory to Christ;
 8  Not only knowledge of the bad,
 8  But even good is versus Christ.
 
 9  Lord, teach us only Thee to touch,
 9  That with Thy life we filled may be,
 9  And not to touch the good or bad,
 9  Or anything apart from Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 
 
 1  The law of God is holy, good,
 1  To practise good it doth command;
 1  Its purpose is to clearly show
 1  That we cannot meet God's demand.
 
 2  Yet in our mind there is a law
 2  Which always tries the good to do;
 2  But in our members is a law
 2  Which always doth this law subdue.
 
 3  The law within our mind is good,
 3  'Tis of our human life obtained
 3  At our creation from the Lord,
 3  That good behavior be maintained.
 
 4  The law within our members is
 4  The evil of satanic life;
 4  Into our members at the fall
 4  It came thru Satan's subtle strife.
 
 5  This evil law of Satan is
 5  The law of sin, in us its seat;
 5  'Tis stronger than the law of good
 5  And always brings it to defeat.
 
 6  But in our spirit is a law,
 6  Which is the Spirit's law of life;
 6  'Tis of the very life of God
 6  Which we from our rebirth derive.
 
 7  This law divine the strongest is,
 7  Transcending all the others o'er;
 7  From sin's law freeing, it fulfills
 7  The full requirement of God's law.
 
 8  We then must always set our mind
 8  Upon the spirit deep within,
 8  And not upon the things of flesh,
 8  The body ruined by the sin.
 
 9  To set the mind upon the flesh
 9  Is sin and death and darkest night;
 9  The mind upon the spirit set
 9  Is life and peace and full of light.
 
 10  This is the way of true release!
 10  This is the way of victory!
 10  Lord, may we in the spirit live,
 10  And by the Spirit walk with Thee.

 1  The law of letters God defines,
 1  It is His testimony true;
 1  It shows how loving, holy, just,
 1  Is God, with whom we have to do.
 
 2  According to His nature shown
 2  God's law requires that we must live,
 2  That He our souls may justify
 2  And unto us His blessing give.
 
 3  The law can never give us life,
 3  Nor any strength to us supply,
 3  But doth its full demands exact
 3  And all our weakness show thereby.
 
 4  It was not for God's final plan,
 4  But for man's sin was introduced,
 4  That man by breaking it might know
 4  Himself, his sin to him adduced.
 
 5  'Tis by the law all mouths are stopped
 5  And all are shut up under sin;
 5  It brings us to the Christ of God
 5  That God may bless us all in Him.
 
 6  The law is but a type of Christ,
 6  Who God's full testimony is,
 6  Who fully has expressed His love,
 6  His holiness and righteousness.
 
 7  'Tis Christ, God's testimony real,
 7  Who doth with life divine supply,
 7  That with the law's demands we may
 7  Be more than able to comply.
 
 8  God's living testimony, He;
 8  By whom God's potent life we share;
 8  Thru Him we're dead unto the law,
 8  And in His Spirit fruit we bear.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  In ancient times the law of God
 1  In letter was engraved on stone;
 1  But now it is a law of life,
 1  Which in our heart is written down.
 
 2  The law in letters good demands
 2  And thus our utter weakness shows;
 2  But now the law of life sustains,
 2  And strength for God to please bestows.
 
 3  The law in letters brings to us
 3  God's knowledge only outwardly;
 3  But now the law of life supplies
 3  A deeper knowledge inwardly.
 
 4  The law in letters can but rule
 4  By dead commandments outwardly;
 4  But now the law of life controls
 4  By living knowledge inwardly.
 
 5  This living law is moving now
 5  In all of our experience,
 5  To regulate us from within
 5  And check us by our inner sense.
 
 6  How deep its regulation is
 6  Within the inmost part of us,
 6  A living consciousness to give,
 6  And God Himself impart to us.
 
 7  'Tis by this living law of life
 7  We need no teaching outwardly,
 7  For all God's living knowledge now
 7  This law will teach us inwardly.
 
 8  Lord, teach us by this law to walk,
 8  Its inner ruling to obey,
 8  That we may of Thyself partake
 8  And know Thee in a living way.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  There is a certain sense of life
 1     With life of every kind;
 1  And in th' eternal life in us
 1     It is a sense divine.
 
 2  The higher any life may be,
 2     The better is its sense;
 2  The life divine the highest is
 2     And has the highest sense.
 
 3  It is the sense of life in us,
 3     It is the sense of God;
 3  'Tis in our spirit made alive,
 3     And more than sense of good.
 
 4  It is the inner sense in us,
 4     The inmost consciousness,
 4  Discerning matters inwardly,
 4     God's will to thus express.
 
 5  'Tis by this sense that God we know,
 5     The sense of inner life;
 5  'Tis pow'rful and spontaneous,
 5     And not of any strife.
 
 6  The greater is our growth in life,
 6     The keener is this sense;
 6  The more we walk and act in life,
 6     The more it is intense.
 
 7  The sense of life when exercised
 7     Will make our spirit bold,
 7  And by this inner sense of God
 7     True fellowship we hold.

 1  In those regenerated by the Lord
 1  There is an inner knowledge bountiful;
 1  Thus we the outward teachings do not need,
 1  But God we inwardly may know in full.
 
 2  Eternal life, the highest and the best,
 2  Possesses full divine capacity,
 2  That by this life God's knowledge we may have
 2  More than by knowledge given outwardly.
 
 3  The law of life is put within our mind
 3  And on our heart 'tis written sovereignly,
 3  Inwardly ruling us that God we know
 3  More than by teachings given outwardly.
 
 4  Holy anointing in our spirit dwells,
 4  Showing the things of God to mind and heart;
 4  By this anointing we God's knowledge have
 4  More than man's teachings can to us impart.
 
 5  We have the triune God indwelling us,
 5  Living and acting, working all the time,
 5  That by the inner sense we have of Him
 5  God we may know in magnitude sublime.
 
 6  This inner knowledge obviates the need
 6  Of outward knowledge, human eloquence,
 6  But in the spirit we must ever live
 6  And walk according to the inner sense.
 
 7  The more we live in Christ, the life divine,
 7  And by the inner consciousness behave,
 7  The more we'll have the inward knowledge true,
 7  And on our heart God will His Son engrave.
 
 8  'Tis by this living inward knowledge gained
 8  That fellowship with God in life we hold;
 8  'Tis by this hidden knowledge thus obtained
 8  God unto us His fulness doth unfold.

 3  Salvation is expounded wholly

 4  Thus God and man in close relation

 5  But God and man to work together

 6  To all our gift and operation,

 1  God ordained us unto sonship,
 1     Ere creation's work was done,
 1  To conform us by His Spirit

 1  That His only dear Begotten
 1     Might become the firstborn One,
 1  And by Him with many brethren
 1     His expression full be won.
 
 2  By divine regeneration
 2     We the sons of God became,
 2  But we must mature to fullness,
 2     Thus the birthright to obtain.
 2  Born and fully grown to manhood,
 2     God's adoption we may share;
 2  By the measure of full stature,
 2     We God's sonship will declare.
 
 3  All our spirit, soul and body
 3     Unto Christ conformed must be;
 3  This will be accomplished fully
 3     When our glorious Lord we see.
 3  By our body's full redemption
 3     Shall adoption be complete;
 3  By the final transformation
 3     All God's purpose we shall meet.
 
 4  By that final transformation,
 4     We'll be fully sanctified;
 4  God will bring us into glory,
 4     With His Son identified.
 4  All creation is expecting
 4     Sons of God revealed to be,
 4  That they might be freed from bondage
 4     Into glorious liberty.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  Man is a being of three parts,
 1  The body, soul, and spirit too,
 1  Th' eternal purpose to fulfill
 1  With God's inheritance in view.
 
 2  The body is the outward part
 2  That man a world-sense may possess;
 2  Thus he may touch the outward things
 2  And bodily himself express.
 
 3  The soul within - the inward part -
 3  Is but the very self of man;
 3  The sense of self it gives to him
 3  To touch the psychic world of man.
 
 4  The spirit is the inmost part
 4  With which the Lord he may receive;
 4  The sense of God it gives to man
 4  That he the spirit-world perceive.
 
 5  Within the soul of man there are
 5  The mind, emotion, and the will;
 5  These are the functions for the man
 5  His human nature to fulfill.
 
 6  Within the spirit of the man
 6  Are found the conscience, fellowship,
 6  And intuition, which thereby
 6  The man to worship God equip.
 
 7  The man must exercise his soul
 7  To choose that God he may possess,
 7  And by his spirit God partake,
 7  And thru his body God express.
 
 8  Man's spirit had to be reborn
 8  With life divine to him conveyed;
 8  His soul must be transformed by God,
 8  His body like Christ's body made.
 
 9  'Tis by these steps of work divine
 9  In each of man's three separate parts
 9  That man is mingled with the Lord
 9  And His expression full imparts.

 1  God created us His vessels

 2  With our heart we have to love Him,

 2  As our life, of Him partaking,
 2     That Himself we may express.
 
 3  Satan has our heart corrupted,

 4  To recover our receiving
 4     And our loving aptitude.
 
 5  It is by our heart's renewal
 5     We may God in love pursue,
 5  And in newness of the spirit
 5     We may contact God anew.
 
 6  Every true and pure and single
 6     To the Lord our heart must be,
 6  Poor in spirit, ever seeking
 6     God to contact constantly.
 
 7  Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness,
 7     And our spirit strengthen more,
 7  That in newness of the spirit
 7     We may touch Thee o'er and o'er.

 1  In dealings with the Lord as life
 1     We need a proper heart,
 1  That of His riches, in His grace,
 1     We fully may take part.
 
 2  We need a heart in all things pure,
 2     With mind both sound and clear,
 2  To understand His mind and heart
 2     In trembling and in fear.
 
 3  We need a fervent, loving heart,
 3     A heart on fire with love,
 3  With an emotion filled with zeal
 3     For Him, all else above.
 
 4  We need a true, obedient heart,
 4     With a submissive will,
 4  A will made pliable, yet strong,
 4     God's purpose to fulfill.
 
 5  We need a heart condemning not,
 5     In all things right with God;
 5  A heart which has a conscience purged
 5     And covered with the blood.
 
 6  Lord, grant us such a heart as this,
 6     Forever fixed on Thee,
 6  That of Thyself we may partake
 6     And Thy true fulness be.

 1  O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
 1     Who in our spirit lives;
 1  One spirit have the two become,
 1     Which oneness to us gives.
 
 2  Thy Spirit with our spirit, Lord,
 2     The witness ever bears
 2  That we the Father's children are
 2     And of God's glory heirs.
 
 3  'Tis in our spirit Thee we touch
 3     Thy riches to enjoy,
 3  And as the Spirit Thou dost give
 3     Thyself without alloy.
 
 4  'Tis in our spirit we may walk
 4     And follow Thee alway,
 4  While, as the Spirit, Thou dost lead
 4     And light impart each day.
 
 5  In spirit, by Thy Spirit, Lord,
 5     We live and worship Thee;
 5  Thou, in our spirit, thru Thine own
 5     Strengtheneth constantly.
 
 6  In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord,
 6     We offer prayer to Thee,
 6  While, as the Spirit, Thou in us
 6     Groanest unutterably.
 
 7  We to our spirit would return
 7     And there would contact Thine;
 7  'Tis in the spirit we may share
 7     Our heritage divine.
 
 8  What oneness, O my Lord, is this -
 8     Two spirits intertwine!
 8  Thy Spirit in our spirit lives,
 8     And ours abides in Thine!

 1  The holiest of God's temple is

 1  God's presence and the ark are there,
 1  And there the priests the Lord may meet.
 
 2  Now we're God's temple in three parts;

 2  The holiest place of holy 'tis.

 3  That God in Christ is all to us;
 3  'Tis here the Holy Spirit makes
 3  The Lord reality to us.
 
 4  'Tis here within the spirit-part
 4  We contact Christ and dwell with Him;
 4  'Tis by our spirit we with God
 4  Have fellowship and worship Him.
 
 5  'Tis here that Christ is like the land
 5  Where we may dwell, its wealth enjoy;
 5  'Tis here that we must fight the foe,
 5  And Christ's authority employ.
 
 6  The spirit we must seek to know,
 6  Discerning spirit from the soul,
 6  And live within this holiest place,
 6  To worship God and reach His goal.
 
 7  The soul we ever must forsake,
 7  Press on, God's rest to enter in,
 7  That Christ we may possess in full
 7  And all God's plan fulfill therein.

 1  By the cross discern the spirit,
 1     Put the soul to death alway;
 1  Bear the cross, deny the self-life,
 1     Walk in spirit day by day.
 
 2  By the cross discern the spirit,
 2     Through the living Word of God,
 2  Separating soul from spirit,
 2     That the right path may be trod.
 
 3  By the cross discern the spirit,
 3     With the mind by light renewed,
 3  All emotion consecrated,
 3     And the will in love subdued.
 
 4  By the cross discern the spirit,
 4     Passing thru the riven veil,
 4  Flesh and soul are wholly broken,
 4     And the spirit doth prevail.
 
 5  By the cross discern the spirit,
 5     'Tis the holiest place divine;
 5  There commune with God in spirit
 5     And His presence will be thine.
 
 6  By the cross discern the spirit,
 6     And the Jordan River cross;
 6  Enter then the Land of Canaan,
 6     And enjoy Christ thru the cross.
 
 7  By the cross discern the spirit,
 7     And within the spirit move;
 7  As good land, on Christ e'er labor,
 7     And His riches thou wilt prove.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  The Spirit of the triune God
 1  Within our spirit now doth rest;
 1  He ever seeks thru us to flow,
 1  That God in Christ may be expressed.
 
 2  But by the outward, natural man
 2  The Spirit is confined within;
 2  Instead of giving Him a home,
 2  A prison we've become to Him.
 
 3  He's like a treasure of great worth
 3  Contained in vessels earthen-made;
 3  The vessel must be broken through
 3  And thus the treasure be displayed.
 
 4  Oh, how the Lord our self must break,
 4  Our outward man does so impede!
 4  It must be broken thoroughly,
 4  And thus the Spirit will be freed.
 
 5  This is the reason why the Lord
 5  For us a certain measure makes
 5  Of circumstantial suffering;
 5  'Tis thus our outward man He breaks.
 
 6  The outward man, the self, the soul,
 6  Must be consumed, must be decreased;
 6  The inner man, our spirit, then
 6  Shall with the Spirit be released.
 
 7  Lord, grant Thy holy brokenness,
 7  Deliver me from being whole;
 7  And make me willing to receive
 7  The wounds that Thou wouldst give my soul.
 
 8  Oh, cause me to appreciate
 8  Thy breaking, never to complain;
 8  And grant that I may value more
 8  All kinds of loss instead of gain.

 1  God's intention is to have us
 1     All conformed to His dear Son;
 1  Thus a work of transformation
 1     By the Spirit must be done.
 
Lord, transform us to Thine image
   In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
   All our being wholly fill.
 
 2  God hath us regenerated
 2     In our spirit with His life;
 2  But He must transform us further -
 2     In our soul by His own life.
 
Lord, transform us to Thine image
   In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
   All our being wholly fill.
 
 3  Spreading outward from our spirit
 3     Doth the Lord transform our soul,
 3  By the inward parts renewing,
 3     Till within His full control.
 
Lord, transform us to Thine image
   In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
   All our being wholly fill.
 
 4  By the power of His Spirit
 4     In His pattern He transforms;
 4  From His glory to His glory
 4     To His image He conforms.
 
Lord, transform us to Thine image
   In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
   All our being wholly fill.
 
 5  He transforms, all sanctifying,
 5     Till like Him we are matured;
 5  He transforms, our soul possessing,
 5     Till His stature is secured.
 
Lord, transform us to Thine image
   In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
   All our being wholly fill.

 1  It is not by struggling,

 1  He healeth me, oh, bless His name!
 1  I want to spread abroad His fame;
 1  From dread disease He sets me free,
 1  The Lord my healer, strong is He!
 
He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
And now by faith He healeth me!
 
 2  He healeth me! My simple faith
 2  Believes the word that Jesus saith,
 2  And takes the place of ardent hope,
 2  Believes the Lord will raise me up.
 
He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
And now by faith He healeth me!
 
 3  He healeth me! I touch for cure
 3  The border of His garment pure,
 3  And virtue through my being flows,
 3  A healing balm for nature's woes.
 
He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
And now by faith He healeth me!
 
 4  He healeth me, as when of yore,
 4  Their sins and sickness He bore;
 4  Nor has He lost His power and skill -
 4  Our blessed Christ is living still.
 
He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
And now by faith He healeth me!
 
 5  He healeth me! How oft I sought
 5  This healing power, but found it not:
 5  But now I trust with all my soul,
 5  And now through faith He makes me whole.
 
He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
And now by faith He healeth me!

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  When Christ of old with healing pow'r
 1  When forth through all the suffering land,
 1  His word so oft was wont to be,
 1  "Stretch forth thy hand, stretch forth thy hand!"
 1  And though the palsied arm might shrink
 1  And tremble at the strange command,
 1  The healing touch was only felt
 1  While stretching forth the withered hand.
 
O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
Upon His promise take your stand.
At His command stretch forth your hand,
   And Christ shall make you whole.
 
 2  That changeless Christ is still as near
 2  And just as kind and strong to save;
 2  He came to lift our fallen race
 2  From sin and sickness and the grave.
 2  As in the days of Galilee,
 2  Disease still flees at His command;
 2  But ere His touch your frame can feel,
 2  You, too, must still stretch forth your hand.
 
O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
Upon His promise take your stand.
At His command stretch forth your hand,
   And Christ shall make you whole.
 
 3  What though you feel so weak and faint?
 3  He can your will with strength endue,
 3  New faith and courage breathe within
 3  And work in you to will and do.
 3  Reach out to meet His quickening touch;
 3  Take up your bed, arise and stand;
 3  And pressing through to meet your Lord,
 3  Stretch forth your hand, stretch forth your hand.
 
O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
Upon His promise take your stand.
At His command stretch forth your hand,
   And Christ shall make you whole.

 1  At even when the sun was set,
 1  The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
 1  O in what divers pains they met!
 1  O with what joy they went away!
 
 2  Once more 'tis eventide, and we
 2  Oppressed with various ills draw near;
 2  What if Thy form we cannot see?
 2  We know and feel that Thou art here.
 
 3  O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;
 3  For some are sick, and some are sad,
 3  And some have never love Thee well
 3  And some have lost the love they had;
 
 4  And some have found the world is vain,
 4  Yet from the world they break not free;
 4  And some have friends who give them pain,
 4  Yet have not sought a friend in Thee;
 
 5  And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
 5  For none are wholly free from sin;
 5  And they who fain would serve Thee best
 5  Are conscious most of wrong within.
 
 6  O Savior Christ, Thou too art Man;
 6  Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
 6  Thy kind but searching glance can scan
 6  The very wounds that shame would hide.
 
 7  Thy touch has still its ancient power;
 7  No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
 7  Hear in this solemn evening hour,
 7  And in Thy mercy heal us all.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Have you found the great Physician,
 1     Jesus Christ of Galilee?
 1  He who bore our pain and sorrow,
 1     On the shameful, cruel tree?
 1  Still He heals the sick and suff'ring,
 1     As before He went away;
 1  For His word most plainly tells us,
 1     "He is just the same today."
 
He is just the same today;
As before He went away.
Look to Him, believe and pray;
Trust His word and then obey.
"Praise God, He is just the same today."
 
 2  Consecrate your life to Jesus,
 2     Spirit, soul, and body too;
 2  For "the Lord is for the body,"
 2     Every pow'r He gave to you.
 2  Let there be no reservation,
 2     Give the Lord full right of way;
 2  He will come and heal His temple,
 2     For He is the same today.
 
He is just the same today;
As before He went away.
Look to Him, believe and pray;
Trust His word and then obey.
"Praise God, He is just the same today."
 
 3  Do you doubt God's will to heal you?
 3     Take His word and ask for light;
 3  If you seek in deep contrition,
 3     He will guide your heart aright.
 3  Do you fear to claim His promise,
 3     He will not your trust betray;
 3  When on earth He gladly healed them,
 3     And He is the same today.
 
He is just the same today;
As before He went away.
Look to Him, believe and pray;
Trust His word and then obey.
"Praise God, He is just the same today."
 
 4  Oh! I'm glad to tell you, suff'rer,
 4     Christ has more than healing too;
 4  Life abundant overflowing,
 4     He will gladly give to you.
 4  Step out boldly, claim His fulness,
 4     Let your sadness flee away;
 4  When on earth He made them joyful,
 4     And He is the same today.
 
He is just the same today;
As before He went away.
Look to Him, believe and pray;
Trust His word and then obey.
"Praise God, He is just the same today."

 1  Just one touch as He moves along,
 1  Pushed and pressed by the jostling throng,
 1  Just one touch and the weak was strong,
 1     Cured by the Healer divine.
 
Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry.
Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
   Christ is the Healer divine.
 
 2  Just one touch! And He makes me whole,
 2  Speaks sweet peace to my sin-sick soul,
 2  At His feet all my burdens roll,
 2     Cured by the Healer divine.
 
Just one touch as He passes by,

Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,

 3  Just one touch! And the work is done,
 3  I am cured by the blessed Son,

 4  O the love in His eyes I see!
 4  I am His for He hears my plea,
 4     Cured by the Healer divine.
 
Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry.
Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
   Christ is the Healer divine.
 
 5  Just one touch! By His mighty power
 5  He can heal thee this very hour,
 5  Thou canst hear though the tempests low'r,
 5     Cured by the Healer divine.
 
Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry.
Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
   Christ is the Healer divine.

 1  She only touched the hem of His garment
 1     As to His side she stole,
 1  Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
 1     And straightway she was whole.
 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
   And thou, too, shalt be free!
His healing pow'r this very hour
   Shall give new life to thee!
 
 2  She came in fear and trembling before Him,
 2     She knew her Lord had come,
 2  She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
 2     The mighty deed was done.
 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment,

His healing pow'r this very hour

 3  He turned with "Daughter, be of good comfort,

 3  And peace that passeth all understanding
 3     With gladness filled her soul.
 
Oh, touch the hem of His garment,

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
 1     Uttered, or unexpressed;
 1  The motion of a hidden fire
 1     That trembles in the breast.
 
 2  Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
 2     The falling of a tear;
 2  The upward glancing of an eye
 2     When none but God is near.
 
 3  Prayer is the simplest form of speech
 3     That infant lips can try;
 3  Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
 3     The Majesty on high.
 
 4  Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
 4     The Christian's native air;
 4  His watchword at the gates of death;
 4     He enters rest with prayer.
 
 5  The saints in prayer appear as one,
 5     In word, and deed, and mind;
 5  While with the Father and the Son
 5     Sweet fellowship they find.
 
 6  O Thou, by whom we come to God,
 6     The Life, the Truth, the Way,
 6  The path of prayer Thyself hast trod -
 6     Lord, teach us how to pray.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  Prayer is the incense of a holy heart
 1  Rising to God from bruised and broken things,
 1  When kindled by the Spirit's burning breath
 1  And upward borne by faith's burning breath
 1  And upward borne by faith's ascending wings.
 
 2  Prayer is the perfume of the plants of grace,
 2  The flowers of patience, faith, and suffering love;
 2  Treasured in "vials full of odors sweet,"
 2  God breathes their fragrance in His courts above.
 
 3  Prayer is th' ascending vapor which supplies
 3  The showers of blessing, and the stream that flows
 3  Through earth's dry places, till on every side
 3  "The wilderness shall blossom as the rose."
 
 4  Prayer is the heavenly telephone that brings
 4  The distant near, till heaven to earth comes down,
 4  And in our Father's ear and heart we may
 4  Our burdens tell and all our sorrows drown.
 
 5  Prayer is the wireless telegraph that sends
 5  Its heart throbs on the ether waves of heaven;
 5  It finds the heart of God, and back to earth
 5  The answering thrill to faith and love are given.
 
 6  Prayer is the golden pipes the Spirit fills,
 6  Which feed the lamps of God with oil divine,
 6  And, as with one accord we wait and pray,
 6  The Spirit fills, the lamps with brightness shine.
 
 7  Prayer is the mightiest force of earth and heaven,
 7  Prayer is the very dynamite of God;
 7  It moves the hand that all things moves, and turns
 7  The living wheels that sweep through earth abroad.
 
 8  Teach us to pray! Move on our hearts, O Lord,
 8  Till Thine own passion all our being move!
 8  Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be
 8  Christ in us praying to the Christ above!
 
 9  Teach us to pray! Reveal Thy will to us,
 9  Till Thine own purpose all our being move!
 9  Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be
 9  God in us answering to the God above!

 1  Christ is the Alpha of our prayers;
 1     We know not how to pray
 1  Save as His Spirit in our hearts
 1     Shall teach us what to say.
 
 2  Christ is the Omega of our prayer,
 2     The Father's great Amen
 2  That rounds our halting periods
 2     To sense beyond our ken.
 
 3  But in the little space between
 3     He lets us make the links,
 3  And with our slow and stammering speech
 3     Interpret what He thinks.
 
 4  O First and Last, take Thou the prayers
 4     Of every trusting soul,
 4  And weld them to Thine own desire
 4     To make a perfect whole.
 
 5  Thou great Beginning of that Word
 5     We cannot speak or spell,
 5  Of the short syllable we lisp
 5     Be Thou the End as well!

 1  Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be,
 1  That in the inmost I to Thee may come;
 1  I would not in my own way pray to Thee,
 1  But let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.
 
 2  It seems Thou art in heaven hearing me,
 2  But right within my spirit Thou dost dwell;
 2  It seems that I am praying unto Thee,
 2  But really from Thyself the prayers do well.
 
 3  When, Lord, no words my burden can express,
 3  My spirit with Thy Spirit deeply groans;
 3  Not verbally I then my plea address,
 3  But Thou dost pray within with words unknown.
 
 4  I would inhale Thee, Lord, e'en as I breathe,
 4  And eat and drink Thee as my life supply.
 4  A deeper fellowship with Thee bequeath
 4  That Thou express Thyself through me thereby.
 
 5  Here in this fellowship Thy light doth shine,
 5  Thy precious blood doth cleanse and make me clean;
 5  May I not only, Lord, Thy light enshrine,
 5  But may Thou be expressed and clearly seen.
 
 6  Thy oil anoints me here in every way,
 6  Anointing Thee within unceasingly;
 6  I more decrease, Thou more increase each day,
 6  Thus full expression Thou shalt have through me.
 
 7  Myself I open that Thou may flow in;
 7  Op'ning myself to others, Lord, flow out;
 7  By such a stream, the fellowship within,
 7  Thou, Lord, expressed will be my life throughout.

 1  To the holiest place I'd come,
 1  There within the veil to be;
 1  There to touch the throne of grace,
 1  Let life's water flow thru me.
 
 2  Now the holiest place of all
 2  Right within my spirit is;
 2  Here the Lord in me abides,
 2  And my spirit joins with His.
 
 3  To my spirit I'd return,
 3  For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;
 3  O how marvellous it is!
 3  He's within, in me complete.
 
 4  Fragrance of the risen Christ
 4  Thru my spirit may be spread;
 4  If in spirit I will pray
 4  Christ will be exhibited.
 
 5  If in spirit Him I touch,
 5  With His riches filled I'll be;
 5  Life and light and love and grace
 5  As a stream will flow thru me.
 
 6  Touching deeply, richly I
 6  Of Himself experience,
 6  Thus the law of life I touch
 6  And His clear anointing sense.
 
 7  In my spirit deeper still
 7  I would touch the Lord I love,
 7  Touch Him in His hidden depth
 7  And His hidden manna prove.
 
 8  When the resurrection life
 8  Is made real in pow'r to me,
 8  As the rod with sprouting buds,
 8  I will then accepted be.
 
 9  Here I find the throne of grace,
 9  Where the living water flows
 9  As a river full of grace
 9  Into me grace to bestow.
 
 10  Then whene'er we meet to pray,
 10  All our spirits we'll release;
 10  Mingled will our spirits be,
 10  And we'll serve the Lord as priests.
 
 11  This the holiest place is too,
 11  Where we all may touch the Lord,
 11  Touch His throne in many ways
 11  Till His grace on us is poured.

 1  The veil is rent and opened is
 1     A new and living way;
 1  With boldness thru the precious blood,
 1     We come to Thee to pray.
 
 2  By Thy redemption we may come
 2     Into the holiest place;
 2  Thy Spirit now anointing us,
 2     We touch the throne of grace.
 
 3  In spirit only we would pray,
 3     Ourselves by Thee possessed,
 3  That from our spirit Christ the Lord
 3     As incense be expressed.
 
 4  Thy grace and mercy as a stream
 4     From out the throne does flow,
 4  Refreshing in the hour of need -
 4     How rich, how sweet to know!
 
 5  Though for our needs we do not ask
 5     But by Thy Spirit pray,
 5  Our every need is known to Thee,
 5     We're in Thy care alway.
 
 6  Though griefs and trials on us press,
 6     We will not anxious be,
 6  But all our care upon Thee cast
 6     And set our spirit free.
 
 7  O may I concentrated be
 7     In fellowship with Thee,
 7  My prayer and incense offering,
 7     Thy Spirit leading me.

 1  Lord, we meet to seek Thy face
 1  And in one accord to pray;
 1  We a holy priesthood are,
 1  Waiting on Thee here today.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 2  As true priests we long to be,
 2  With our spirit sense Thy will,
 2  Thus to serve before Thee here
 2  That Thy plan Thou may fulfill.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 3  To the holiest place we come,
 3  Now to touch Thy throne of grace,
 3  By the inner sense to pray
 3  And Thy Spirit's flow to trace.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 4  From Thy throne of grace to me
 4  Rivers of Thy grace proceed;
 4  Thus my spirit is refreshed,
 4  Helping me in time of need.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 5  May our prayers expression give
 5  To Thy Spirit's mind alone;
 5  Praying not by our desire,
 5  But according to Thine own.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 6  Though with temporal matters pressed,
 6  Which we fain would bring to Thee,
 6  Rather than Thy care to seek,
 6  We would here Thy channel be.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.
 
 7  Here we seek Thy list'ning ear,
 7  May Thy living water flow;
 7  When Thy grace does satisfy,
 7  Only then Thy work we'll know.
 
Here together we would pray,
Touch the highest and the best,
Till our spirits mingled are
And Thy Church is built and blest.

 1  It shall be done, doubt not His Word,

 5  It shall be done, the foe ignored,
 5  Command thy mountain in the Lord!
 
 6     Take then the faith of God,
 6     Free from the taint of doubt;
 6     The wonder-working rod
 6     That casts all reasoning out.
 6  It shall be done, stand on the Word.
 6  Command thy mountain in the Lord!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Exercise the spirit,
 1  Pray in every way!
 1  I have prayed too little,
 1  Keen my spirit, nay.
 1  Even when I prayed, my
 1  Spirit seldom proved
 1  Ever just to follow
 1  As Thy Spirit moved.
 
 2  Now I'd pray in spirit
 2  As Thy Spirit groans;
 2  Pray by the anointing,
 2  Not as memory owns.
 2  Not the mind applying,
 2  But with spirit pray,
 2  Praising or beseeching,
 2  Spirit-led alway.
 
 3  Not just by myself my
 3  Spirit exercise,
 3  But with others praying
 3  I would do likewise;
 3  Praying in the spirit,
 3  As the spirit wants,
 3  For 'tis in the inmost
 3  Spirits have response.
 
 4  When we serve together,
 4  We thru prayer would move,
 4  Fellowship in spirit,
 4  Not in word to prove.
 4  Never pray together,
 4  Shouting, crying much,
 4  Yet the fellowship in
 4  Spirit never touch.
 
 5  Exercise the spirit
 5  Here and everywhere,
 5  Few or many present,
 5  Caring not who's there.
 5  Not a place or person
 5  Will influence me,
 5  In all kinds of meetings
 5  I'll my spirit free.
 
 6  Thus my spirit lifted
 6  Gives the Lord His way;
 6  Thus, my spirit strengthened,
 6  I'll be used each day.
 6  In the spirit's flowing
 6  Living water see;
 6  Thus the saints are mingled,
 6  Built the church will be.

 1  Praying to express the Lord,
 1  We must not ourselves express,
 1  But let Christ reveal Himself,
 1  His desire in us impress.

 2  We must utter His intent,
 2  Quieting our human thoughts

 4  Letting Him beseech in us;
 4  Christ indwelling prays within

 5  Learning not to pray by self,
 5  Praying wholly with the Lord,
 5  Praying only by Himself.

 1  I must tell Jesus all of my trials;
 1  I cannot bear these burdens alone;
 1  In my distress He kindly will help me;
 1  He ever loves and cares for His own.
 
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
I cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
 
 2  I must tell Jesus all of my troubles;
 2  He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
 2  If I but ask Him, He will deliver,
 2  And in my griefs with me He will blend.
 
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
I cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
 
 3  Tempted and tried I need a great Savior,
 3  One who can help my burdens to bear;
 3  I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;
 3  He all my cares and sorrows will share.
 
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
I cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
 
 4  O how the world to evil allures me!
 4  O how my heart is tempted to sin!
 4  I must tell Jesus; He will enable
 4  Over the world the vic'try to win.
 
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
I cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  When thou wakest in the morning
 1     Ere thou tread'st the untried way
 1  Of the lot that lies before thee
 1     Through the coming busy day;
 1  Whether sunbeams promise brightness,
 1     Whether dim forebodings fall,
 1  Be thy dawning glad or gloomy,
 1     Go to Jesus, tell Him all.
 
 2  In the calm of sweet communion
 2     Let thy daily work be done;
 2  In the peace of soul-outpouring
 2     Care be banished, patience won;
 2  And if earth with its enchantments
 2     Seek thy spirit to enthrall,
 2  Ere thou listen, ere thou answer,
 2     Turn to Jesus, tell Him all.
 
 3  Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,
 3     Thou wilt blessed guidance know,
 3  Thine own burdens being lightened,
 3     Thou canst bear another's woe;
 3  Thou canst help the weak ones onward,
 3     Thou canst raise up those that fall:
 3  But remember, while thou servest,
 3     Still tell Jesus, tell Him all.
 
 4  And if weariness creeps o'er thee
 4     As the day wears to its close,
 4  Or if sudden fierce temptation
 4     Bring thee face to face with foes;
 4  In thy weakness, in thy peril,
 4     Raise to heaven a truthful call;
 4  Strength and calm for every crisis
 4     Come, in telling Jesus all.

 1  What a Friend we have in Jesus,
 1     All our sins and griefs to bear!
 1  What a privilege to carry
 1     Everything to God in prayer!
 1  O what peace we often forfeit,
 1     O what needless pain we bear,
 1  All because we do not carry
 1     Everything to God in prayer!
 
 2  Have we trials and temptations?
 2     Is there trouble anywhere?
 2  We should never be discouraged,
 2     Take it to the Lord in prayer.
 2  Can we find a friend so faithful
 2     Who will all our sorrows share?
 2  Jesus knows our every weakness,
 2     Take it to the Lord in prayer.
 
 3  Are we weak and heavy-laden,
 3     Cumbered with a load of care?
 3  Precious Savior, still our refuge -
 3     Take it to the Lord in prayer;
 3  Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
 3     Take it to the Lord in prayer;
 3  In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
 3     Thou wilt find a solace there.

 1  "Keep the incense burning"
 1     On the altar fire;
 1  Let thy heart's petition,
 1     Let thy deep desire,
 1  Be a cloud of incense
 1     Wreathing God's own throne,
 1  Till His will among us
 1     Shall be fully done.
 
 2  "Keep the incense burning"
 2     On the altar fire;
 2  Feed the flame, Lord Jesus,
 2     Till Thy whole desire
 2  Shall in us, Thy children,
 2     Find free course, and be
 2  Breathed through lips anointed
 2     For this ministry.
 
 3  "Keep the incense burning"
 3     Though the faith be weak;
 3  Though in words thou canst not
 3     All thy longings speak;
 3  Silent heart-petitions,
 3     Spirit-taught, will be
 3  Gloriously answered;
 3     Wrought by God for thee.
 
 4  "Keep the incense burning,"
 4     Hourly let it rise,
 4  Till from opened heavens,
 4     Till from flame-swept skies,
 4  Fire shall fall and kindle
 4     All hearts to a flame;
 4  Making us a glory
 4     To our Savior's name.

 1  The priest's position holy is;
 1  He sacrifices e'er to God,
 1  Beholds His beauty, incense burns
 1     Of prayer before the Lord.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 2  No natural light, but just the lamp
 2  Within the holy place gives sight;
 2  Whene'er the priest the incense burns,
 2     The lamp he too must light.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 3  The grace of God let us extol
 3  And stir our heart sweet praise to sing;
 3  For priests not only light the lamp,
 3     But constant praises bring.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 4  I'll offer prayers as incense burns,
 4  Christ's resurrection bring therein,
 4  God's wish thus meet, His heart give joy,
 4     And I'll rejoice with Him.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 5  I'll read His Word, His light receive,
 5  E'en as the lamp before Him lit,
 5  His holy light illum'ning me
 5     To others I'll transmit.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 6  Unto the Lord His praise I'll sing
 6  As holy priests their songs did raise;
 6  O may my heart be filled with Him
 6     His love and grace to praise.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.
 
 7  I'll offer Christ to God in prayer,
 7  I'll read the Word, His light to know,
 7  For all His grace I'll sing His praise,
 7     The Spirit then may flow.
 
Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
Our praise to Him outpoured.

 1  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 1  First let Him speak to thee, then speak to Him;
 1  True prayer in thee the Lord initiates,
 1  Thou but a channel art expressing Him.
 
 2  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 2  Learn to deny thy thought and all thy will.
 2  Learn to let God anoint thee with Himself
 2  And thru thy prayer His purposes fulfill.
 
 3  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 3  Silent to all thy wishes and thy plans,
 3  Silent to all thy earthly cares and calls,
 3  That God may work in thee all His demands.
 
 4  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 4  Yield to the spirit all thy heart and mind;
 4  Here let the spirit show what God reveals,
 4  Thee its obedient servant thus to find.
 
 5  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 5  Learn thus to let the Spirit pray thru thee;
 5  All of thy being with the Spirit move,
 5  Thy prayer will thus God's own expression be.
 
 6  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 6  Till in the spirit thou with God art one,
 6  Till thru the spirit God possesses all
 6  And thus transforms each part unto His Son.
 
 7  My soul, be silent, wait upon the Lord!
 7  Till God may freely, fully flow thru thee,
 7  Till all thy words and actions hour by hour
 7  Are the fulfillment of God's will thru thee.

 1  Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, I care not how,
 1  But stir my heart in passion for the world,
 1  Stir me to give, to go, but most to pray;
 1  Stir till the blood-red banner be unfurled
 1  O'er lands that still in heathen darkness lie,
 1  O'er deserts where no cross is lifted high.
 
 2  Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till all my heart
 2  Is filled with strong compassion for these souls;
 2  Till Thy compelling word drives me to pray;
 2  Till Thy constraining love reach to the poles
 2  Far north and south, in burning deep desire,
 2  Till east and west are caught in love's great fire.
 
 3  Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till prayer is pain,
 3  Till prayer is joy, till prayer turns into praise;
 3  Stir me, till heart and will and mind, yea, all
 3  Is wholly Thine to use through all the days.
 3  Stir, till I learn to pray exceedingly;
 3  Stir, till I learn to wait expectantly.
 
 4  Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, Thy heart was stirred
 4  By love's intensest fire, till Thou didst give
 4  Thine only Son, Thy best beloved One,
 4  E'en to the dreadful cross, that I might live.
 4  Stir me to give myself so back to Thee,
 4  That Thou canst give Thyself again through me.
 
 5  Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, for I can see
 5  Thy glorious triumph-day begin to break;
 5  The dawn already gilds the eastern sky;
 5  Oh, Church of Christ, arise, awake, awake.
 5  Oh! stir us, Lord, as heralds of that day.
 5  For night is past, our King is on His way.

 1  All Scripture is the very breath of God,
 1  And by His Spirit into words was breathed;
 1  By godly men the words were written down,
 1  With all God's fulness unto man bequeathed.
 
 2  It is the breath of God as light to man,
 2  With rays divine man to illuminate;
 2  It shines in darkness and to man reveals.
 2  What is his truest need and actual state.
 
 3  It is the breath of God as life to man,
 3  Nature divine to man it doth impart;
 3  The dead it quickens and regenerates,
 3  Transforms the soul-life and renews the heart.
 
 4  It is the breath of God as wisdom too,
 4  Knowledge divine to man it has to teach;
 4  Th' eternal purpose of the Lord it shows,
 4  And leadeth man God's final goal to reach.
 
 5  It is the breath of God as strength to man,
 5  Power divine to man it doth transmit,
 5  Strength'ning the weak, empowering the faint,
 5  Enabling man God's purpose full to fit.
 
 6  It is the breath of God for us to breath,
 6  That as our portion God we may enjoy;
 6  Receiving it by spirits exercised,
 6  Our need is met, His wealth we may employ.

 1  God the Lord has spoken, God has been unveiled;
 1  All His character and persons are expressed;
 1  Unto Adam's sons His mystery is revealed,
 1  Fully illustrated and made manifest.
 
 2  God the Lord has spoken, and His heart disclosed,
 2  That His Son should have pre-eminence in all,
 2  That in His dear Son He might be glorified
 2  Midst all His creation, either great or small.
 
 3  God the Lord has spoken, Christ has been revealed:
 3  He is very God and yet is truly man;
 3  He is all in all, in Him all things subsist,
 3  Center and circumference of th' eternal plan.
 
 4  God the Lord has spoken, and His mystery shown,
 4  Christ and His expression has His counsel willed:
 4  Christ with all God's fulness as the glorious Head,
 4  And the Church His Body, with His riches filled.
 
 5  God the Lord has spoken, and from heaven shown
 5  That the triune God would blend with creature-man:
 5  Father in the Son, the Son the Spirit is,
 5  Dwelling in the Body to fulfill His plan.
 
 6  God the Lord has spoken, revelation giv'n
 6  Of His vast creation and His lowly birth,
 6  Of His great redemption and salvation full;
 6  May His adoration ever fill the earth.

 1  O living Word of God, God's image true,
 1  Thou art the content of God's written word;
 1  God in Thee we have met, God's fulness found.
 1  And in the Scripture we Thyself have heard.
 
 2  No man has e'er seen God, apart from Thee,
 2  Without the Scripture Thee we'd hardly see;
 2  Thou to the human race God hast declared,
 2  And thru the Scripture Thou art shown to me.
 
 3  Perfect embodiment Thou art of God,
 3  A portrait full the Scripture gives of Thee;
 3  In Thee we comprehend God's image true,
 3  And thru the Scripture Thou art real to me.
 
 4  Life-giving Spirit Thou, as well as Word,
 4  Now e'en the Spirit in the Word Thou art;
 4  When thru the Spirit giv'n, I touch the Word,
 4  Fulness divine to me Thou dost impart.
 
 5  In Thee I may with God have fellowship,
 5  And thru the Scripture I on Thee may feed;
 5  Thru study of the Word with prayer to God
 5  Thy glorious riches fully meet my need.
 
 6  Teach me to exercise my spirit, Lord,
 6  Thy Word to study, so to contact Thee,
 6  That Thou, the living Word, with Scripture, too,
 6  As one my daily manna e'er may be.

 1  Thou art the Word and Spirit, Lord;
 1  Now in one spirit worship we;
 1  'Tis by the Word we understand,
 1  And in the Spirit contact Thee.
 
 2  Since Thou with me has joined in one,
 2  Thou art my all, O Lord, thereby;
 2  And as the Spirit and the Word
 2  Thou cam'st to me as my supply.
 
 3  If Thou art Lord, yet not the Word,
 3  How couldest Thou be know to me?
 3  If Thou art God yet Spirit not,
 3  How could I ever contact Thee?
 
 4  The Word reveals Thyself to me
 4  And knowledge of Thyself imparts;
 4  The Spirit is Thy substance true
 4  Whereby I touch Thee as Thou art.
 
 5  Thou art my life, my light, my way,
 5  My food, my strength and guaranty;
 5  By Word made known, as Spirit these
 5  Become experience to me.
 
 6  The Word in Scripture is expressed,
 6  Thy Spirit, the Indwelling One;
 6  Thy Word is spirit and is life
 6  When to my spirit it doth come.
 
 7  If I Thy Word would understand,
 7  I must Thy Holy Spirit touch;
 7  Not only grasp it with my mind,
 7  But with my spirit, praying much.
 
 8  Thy precious Word my heart doth love,
 8  My spirit fellowships with Thine;
 8  My heart rejoices in Thy Word,
 8  My spirit praises sings in Thine.

 1  O Word of God incarnate,
 1     O Wisdom from on high,
 1  O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
 1     O Light of our dark sky,
 1  We praise Thee for the radiance
 1     That from the hallowed page,
 1  A lantern to the footsteps,
 1     Shines on from age to age.
 
 2  The Church from her dear Master
 2     Received the gift divine,
 2  And still that light she lifteth
 2     O'er all the earth to shine:
 2  It is the golden treasure
 2     Where gems of truth are stored;
 2  It is the heaven-drawn picture

 3  It floateth like a banner
 3     Before God's host unfurled;
 3  It shineth like a beacon
 3     Above the darkling world;
 3  It is the chart and compass
 3     That, o'er life's surging sea,
 3  'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands
 3     Still guide, O Christ, to Thee.
 
 4  O make Thy Church, dear Savior,
 4     A lampstand of pure gold,
 4  To bear before the nations
 4     Thy light, that all behold;
 4  O teach Thy wandering pilgrims
 4     By this their path to trace,
 4  Till, clouds and darkness ended,
 4     They see Thee face to face.

 1  Thy Word is like a storehouse, Lord,
 1     With full provision there,
 1  And everyone who seeks may come,
 1     Its glorious wealth to share.
 1  Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine,
 1     And jewels rich and rare
 1  Are hidden in its mighty depths
 1     For every searcher there.
 
 2  Thy Word is like a starry host:

 2  Are seen to guide the traveler,
 2     And make his pathway bright.
 2  Thy Word is like an armory,
 2     Where soldiers may repair,
 2  And find, for life's long battle day,
 2     All needful weapons there.
 
 3  O may I love Thy precious Word,

 3     May light upon me shine.
 3  O may I find my armor there,

 4  Lord, grant us all aright to learn
 4     The wisdom it imparts,
 4  And to its heav'nly teaching turn,
 4     With simple, child-like hearts.

 5  Speak to me by name, O Master,
 5     Let me know it is to me;

 5  In the shadow of the Rock!

 4  One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.
 
 5  One word of final triumph, Lord;
 5  Sweet hope Thy promises afford,
 5  To dwell with Thee in sweet accord;
 5  One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;
 1  I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;
 1  All that I need is none other but Thee,
 1  Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 2  Thou art the food and the water of life,
 2  Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;
 2  I long to eat and to drink here of Thee,
 2  Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 3  Thou art the Word with God's fulness in Thee,
 3  Thou too the Spirit that God my life be;
 3  Thee in the Word I enjoy as my food,
 3  Thou as the Spirit art water to me.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 4  Thou from the heavens as food camest down,
 4  Thou to be drink hast been smitten for me;
 4  Thou as the food, my exhaustless supply,
 4  Thou as the water, a stream unto me.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 5  Thou in the Word art the Spirit and life,
 5  Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;
 5  Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live,
 5  Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 6  Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,
 6  On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.
 6  Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,
 6  Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 7  Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,
 7  Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;
 7  Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,
 7  Praying and reading - Lord, Thou art my fare.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.
 
 8  Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;
 8  Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;
 8  May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me
 8  As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.
 
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

 1  I come before Thy throne of grace
 1  With hungry heart on Thee to feed,
 1  Thy grace and mercy to receive
 1  To help me in this hour of need.
 
 2  Here I behold Thy radiant face,
 2  Its light upon my heart doth shine
 2  With healing rays consuming all
 2  The weaknesses and faults of mine.
 
 3  'Tis here Thy light illuminates
 3  My true condition unto me;
 3  'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness
 3  To cleanse from sin I gladly see.
 
 4  Thy Spirit too anoints me here
 4  And makes Thy very substance mine;
 4  Thy very self I thus enjoy
 4  And know Thy very heart's design.
 
 5  Thy Word I read before Thee here
 5  E'en as the priests the lamp did light;
 5  Thy Spirit is as oil to me
 5  To light Thy Word and give me sight.
 
 6  E'en as the priests the incense burned,
 6  In prayer to Thee I persevere;
 6  As incense Thou the Spirit art
 6  Mixed with the prayer I offer here.
 
 7  Thy Word is light, Thy Word is food;
 7  Which doth enlighten and supply;
 7  I long to read and feed much more,
 7  For light and food to satisfy.
 
 8  Thou art the living water too
 8  Which full revival doth bestow;
 8  I wish to pray and drink e'en more
 8  That through me living rivers flow.
 
 9  Thou art the incense unto God,
 9  In Thee acceptance is complete;
 9  I want to pray yet more and more,
 9  To offer up this fragrance sweet.
 
 10  By reading I'm enlightened, filled,
 10  By prayer my thirst is quenched indeed;
 10  Thus Thou to me may be supplied,
 10  And Thou through me may meet the need.
 
 11  I long to have such fellowship,
 11  To read and pray and blend with Thee;
 11  I long that Thou wouldst saturate
 11  Till Thou may overflow from me.

 1  "Man shall not live by bread alone,
 1  But by each word which doth proceed
 1  From God's own mouth"; these we must eat
 1  And let them be our life indeed.
 
 2  Not just a body we were made,
 2  But body, soul, and spirit too;
 2  The inmost part the spirit is
 2  To contact God and Him pursue.
 
 3  Just as we need the earthly food
 3  Our body's need to satisfy,
 3  We need the food for spirit too -
 3  Thyself, Thy Word, its true supply.
 
 4  Thou art the Spirit, and Thy Word
 4  Thy very Self expressed doth make;
 4  Thus, it is Spirit as Thyself,
 4  Which by our spirit we must take.
 
 5  Thus, to receive Thy Word is not
 5  To read it only with our eyes
 5  And understand it in our mind,
 5  But 'tis the spirit's exercise.
 
 6  Thy Word in spirit we must eat
 6  And to our inmost part receive;
 6  'Tis by our spirit's exercise
 6  To pray with what our minds perceive.
 
 7  Thy Word remaining in our mind
 7  Is only knowledge burdensome,
 7  But when it to the spirit goes
 7  Then life and spirit it becomes.
 
 8  'Tis only when our spirit acts
 8  To take Thy Word and contact Thee,
 8  We truly feed upon Thy Word
 8  And touch Thyself most inwardly.
 
 9  Lord, teach us how to exercise
 9  Our spirit when Thy Word we read;
 9  Then will our spirit nourished be
 9  As thus upon Thyself we feed.

 1  Christ is the Word and Spirit too,
 1     And as the Spirit in the Word;
 1  And all the words He speaks to us
 1     Are life and spirit thus conferred.
 
 2  The Holy Word we have without,
 2     The Holy Spirit is within;
 2  The greatest gifts divine are these,
 2     That we may God enjoy therein.
 
 3  The Word the Spirit doth express,
 3     The Spirit its reality;
 3  They're but two aspects of one thing
 3     And should not separated be.
 
 4  Whene'er the Spirit lights the Word
 4     The Word becometh life to us;
 4  When Word from Spirit is divorced,
 4     'Tis empty mental stimulus.
 
 5  When we the Word in spirit touch,
 5     As life the Spirit it becomes;
 5  The Spirit, when expressed from us,
 5     As words of life to others comes.
 
 6  Our spirit we must exercise
 6     To take the Word most inwardly,
 6  And then to give the Spirit forth;
 6     The two as one with us should be.
 
 7  Lord, may Thy Word in me become
 7     The Spirit as my life supply,
 7  And may Thy Spirit in Thy Word
 7     My true expression be thereby.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  God's own Word must not be taken
 1     Just as knowledge but as life,
 1  Not alone God's thought conveying,
 1     But Himself to us as life;
 1  Not alone God's mind revealing,
 1     But His Christ as life within,
 1  Not alone the teaching giving,
 1     But experience of Him.
 
 2  It is only knowledge to us
 2     If we in the letter read,
 2  But when reading in the spirit
 2     It is truly life indeed.
 2  All the knowledge in the letter
 2     Only brings us into death,
 2  But the Word in spirit taken
 2     Gives to us the quickening breath.
 
 3  It we miss the Lord in Scripture,
 3     It is just as knowledge vain;
 3  But when Christ we touch within it,
 3     Then His life we may obtain.
 3  When we read, the Lord not touching,
 3     'Tis but mental stimulus;
 3  But when Christ we touch by reading,
 3     It becometh life to us.
 
 4  All the knowledge of the Scriptures
 4     Into life must be transformed,
 4  All the mental understanding
 4     In the spirit must be formed;
 4  All the Scriptural understanding
 4     Must become the life received,
 4  All the knowledge of the letters
 4     In the spirit be conceived.
 
 5  Just to touch the Word for knowledge
 5     Is to take the very way
 5  By which Eve was lured by Satan
 5     And by knowledge led astray;
 5  But as life to take the Scripture
 5     Is the tree of life to eat;
 5  Thus the Word we must be taking
 5     In the spirit as our meat.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  We limit not the truth of God
 1     To our poor reach of mind,
 1  By notions of our day and sect,
 1     Crude, partial and confined.
 1  Now let a new and better hope
 1     Within our hearts be stirred:
 1  The Lord hath yet more light and truth
 1     To break forth from His Word.
 
 2  Who dares to bind by his dull sense
 2     The oracles of heaven,
 2  For all the nations, tongues and climes
 2     And all the ages given!
 2  The universe how much unknown!
 2     That ocean unexplored!
 2  The Lord hath yet more light and truth
 2     To break forth from His Word.
 
 3  Darkling our great forefathers went
 3     The first steps of the way;
 3  'Twas but the dawning yet to grow
 3     Into the perfect day;
 3  And grow it shall, our glorious Sun
 3     More fervid rays afford:
 3  The Lord hath yet more light and truth
 3     To break forth from His Word.
 
 4  The valleys past, ascending still,
 4     Our souls would higher climb,
 4  And look down from supernal heights,
 4     On all the bygone times;
 4  Upward we press, the air is clear,
 4     And the sphere-music heard!
 4  The Lord hath yet more light and truth
 4     To break forth from His Word.
 
 5  O Father, Son and Spirit, send
 5     Us increase from above;
 5  Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts
 5     To comprehend Thy love;
 5  And make us all go on to know
 5     With nobler powers conferred:
 5  The Lord hath yet more light and truth
 5     To break forth from His Word.

 1  Christ is the mystery of God;
 1  God is invisible, unshown,
 1  His image man hath never seen,
 1  But Christ the Son hath made Him known.
 
 2  Christ is the very Word of God,
 2  He is God's explanation true;
 2  God's full embodiment is He
 2  And God's own image brings to view.
 
 3  Image of God invisible,
 3  Effulgence of God's glory fair;
 3  God's fulness ever dwells in Him,
 3  God's testimony He doth bear.
 
 4  The Church the myst'ry is of Christ,
 4  For He is now to man unshown;
 4  No man on earth may see Him now,
 4  But thru the Church He is made known.
 
 5  The Church is Christ's expression full,
 5  In her Christ dwelleth bodily;
 5  She is His duplication true,
 5  And man in her Himself may see.
 
 6  The Church the image has of Christ,
 6  She is His increase and His spread;
 6  Christ's very self is found in her,
 6  The Body, she, to Christ the Head.
 
 7  Thus, in the Son the Father is,
 7  And now the Spirit is the Son;
 7  The Spirit of the triune God
 7  Is in the Church and with her one.

 1  As the body is the fulness
 1     To express our life,
 1  So to Christ the Church, His Body,
 1     Doth express His life.
 
 2  E'en as Eve is part of Adam
 2     Taken out of him,
 2  So the Church is Christ's own increase
 2     With Himself within.
 
 3  As from out the buried kernel
 3     Many grains are formed,
 3  As the grains together blended
 3     To a loaf are formed;
 
 4  So the Church, of many Christians,
 4     Christ doth multiply,
 4  Him expressing as one Body,
 4     God to glorify.
 
 5  As the branches of the grapevine
 5     Are its outward spread,
 5  With it one, abiding, bearing
 5     Clusters in its stead;
 
 6  So the Church's many members
 6     Christ's enlargement are,
 6  One with Him in life and living,
 6     Spreading Him afar.
 
 7  Fulness, increase, duplication,
 7     His expression full,
 7  Growth and spread, continuation,
 7     Surplus plentiful,
 
 8  Is the Church to Christ, and thereby
 8     God in Christ may be
 8  Glorified thru His redeemed ones
 8     To eternity.
 
 9  Thus the Church and Christ together,
 9     God's great mystery,
 9  Is the mingling of the Godhead
 9     With humanity.

 1  The Church the vessel is to Christ,
 1  Him to contain and Him express,
 1  Just as the human body doth
 1  Man's life show forth, his life possess.
 
 2  As was the temple to the ark,
 2  Receptacle and resting-place;
 2  So Christ the Church's content is,
 2  And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.
 
 3  As Christ is God's true mystery,
 3  God to explain and God express;
 3  So is the Church Christ's mystery,
 3  Christ to explain and manifest.
 
 4  The members of the Church of Christ
 4  Are all primarily of clay;
 4  They need to be transformed and made
 4  Transparent, precious day by day.
 
 5  By transformation they are built,
 5  A vessel they to Christ afford;
 5  His all-inclusiveness they hold;
 5  Transparent, they express the Lord.
 
 6  Thru all the transformation work
 6  The triune God performs in them,
 6  The Church a corporate vessel is
 6  And like the new Jerusalem.
 
 7  How precious she in each respect,
 7  Transparent too in every phase;
 7  Christ with God's fulness she contains,
 7  Christ with God's glory she displays.
 
 8  With Christ as life, with God as light,
 8  And with the Spirit's living flow,
 8  The triune God she manifests
 8  For all the universe to know.

 1  The Church the lampstand is to Christ,
 1  Christ is the lamp with God as light;
 1  The light divine from Christ doth shine,
 1  The Church upholds its glory bright.
 
 2  The light which shines within the lamp
 2  Is God as life, unique, divine;
 2  The stand must therefore be of gold
 2  To match the glory which doth shine.
 
 3  Amid the darkness of this age
 3  The light of life divine doth beam
 3  In many centers of mankind
 3  Where Jesus' testimony's seen.
 
 4  To be this testimony pure
 4  "First love" to Christ the Church must keep;
 4  Then from the "tree of life" she may
 4  The overcomer's portion reap.
 
 5  She must the persecution bear
 5  That she the "crown of life" may gain;
 5  Adult'ry spiritual o'ercome,
 5  The "hidden manna" to obtain.
 
 6  The deeds of "Jezebel" desert,
 6  That she may rule the earth with might;
 6  Defiling deadness overcome
 6  To be arrayed in "garments white."
 
 7  Like "Philadelphia" she must be
 7  To keep Christ's word, confess His Name;
 7  All "lukewarm" pride she must o'ercome
 7  To feast with Him who overcame.
 
 8  Thus will the Church be purified
 8  To be the lampstand of pure gold,
 8  To match the testimony pure,
 8  The life of Jesus fit to hold.
 
 9  The local churches here on earth
 9  The lampstands in this age should be;
 9  The glorious new Jerusalem
 9  The lampstand in eternity.
 
 10  The city as pure gold will be,
 10  The final lampstand consummate;
 10  Christ as the lamp she e'er will hold
 10  And God's full light will radiate.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  God before the world's foundation
 1     Chose the Church in Christ the Son,
 1  That the Church might share the sonship,
 1     Holy, blameless, with Him one;
 1  That the Church be His possession
 1     With the Spirit as the seal,
 1  Of our heritage the earnest
 1     While His Son He does reveal.
 
 2  To the throne Christ has ascended,
 2     Far above all rule and power;
 2  God has made Him Head o'er all things
 2     To the Church, His Body here.
 2  All in He ever filleth,
 2     And His fulness is expressed
 2  Through the Church, which is His Body
 2     And His image manifests.
 
 3  We, once dead in our offences,
 3     Walking in the worldly course,
 3  Lusts of flesh and mind fulfilling,
 3     Satan and his hosts their source,
 3  God with Christ has resurrected,
 3     Seated in the heavenlies;
 3  We, His masterpiece, created
 3     In Christ Jesus, Him to please.
 
 4  Jews and Gentiles are one body -
 4     God His myst'ry has made known -
 4  On apostles, prophets founded,
 4     Jesus Christ the cornerstone;
 4  We in Him are built together
 4     For God's dwelling manifest,
 4  Fitly framed by God the Spirit
 4     For His pleasure and His rest.
 
 5  In eternal ages purposed
 5     That His wisdom be made known,
 5  Was the Church, His hidden myst'ry,
 5     Where the Son could make His home;
 5  That the saints may all in spirit
 5     Apprehend His boundlessness,
 5  Know His love which passes knowledge,
 5     All God's fulness to possess.
 
 6  One in body, hope, and Spirit,
 6     One in faith, one Lord, the Son,
 6  One baptizing, with one Father,
 6     That the Church may thus be one;
 6  Christ to know in all His fulness,
 6     Unto manhood be matured,
 6  Ne'er by winds of doctrine carried,
 6     Nor by cunning men allured.
 
 7  Many gifts the Lord has given,
 7     That His Body He may build,
 7  That the saints may be perfected
 7     And their ministry fulfilled.
 7  Thus we must put off the old man
 7     That we may put on the new;
 7  Thus, renewed in mind and spirit,
 7     We will bear God's image true.
 
 8  Christ in love Himself has given
 8     That the Church be sanctified,
 8  Without blemish, spot, or wrinkle,
 8     To become His glorious bride.
 8  He does nourish her and cherish
 8     As a man his body treats;
 8  He and she become one body -
 8     Thus the myst'ry very great.
 
 9  Body, house, new man the Church is,
 9     Bride, and temple, and yet more:
 9  She's the army too which fighteth
 9     All God's foe to triumph o'er.
 9  She is clothed with all God's armor,
 9     In His mighty strength is strong,
 9  Standing in the Lord, resisting,
 9     With all prayers she fighteth on.

 1  The Church is Christ's own Body,
 1     The Father's dwelling-place,
 1  The gathering of the called ones,
 1     God blended with man's race;
 1  Elect before creation,
 1     Redeemed by Calv'ry's death,
 1  Her character and standing
 1     Of heaven, not of earth.
 
 2  New man of new creation,
 2     Born through her risen Lord,
 2  Baptized in God the Spirit,
 2     Made holy by His Word;
 2  Christ is her life and content,
 2     Himself her glorious Head;
 2  She has ascended with Him
 2     O'er all her foes to tread.
 
 3  Christ is her one foundation,
 3     None other man may lay;
 3  All that she has, as Christ, is
 3     Divine in every way;
 3  Her members through the Spirit
 3     Their death on Calv'ry own;
 3  They're built in resurrection -
 3     Gold, silver, precious stone.
 
 4  One God, one Lord, one Spirit -
 4     Her elements all one -
 4  One faith, one hope, one baptism,
 4     One Body in the Son;
 4  The triune God is in her,
 4     One Body members own,
 4  By faith they are united,
 4     In hope of glory shown.
 
 5  From every tribe and nation
 5     Do all the members come,
 5  Regardless of their classes
 5     United to be one.
 5  No high there is, nor lowly,
 5     No Jew, nor Gentile clan,
 5  No free, nor slave, nor master,
 5     But Christ, the "one new man."
 
 6  One Body universal,
 6     One in each place expressed;
 6  Locality of dwelling
 6     Her only ground possessed;
 6  Administration local,
 6     Each answ'ring to the Lord;
 6  Communion universal,
 6     Upheld in one accord.
 
 7  Her local gatherings model
 7     The New Jerusalem;
 7  Its aspects and its details
 7     Must show in all of them.
 7  Christ is the Lamp that shineth,
 7     With God within, the Light;
 7  They are the lampstands bearing
 7     His glorious Image bright.

 1  Church of God, beloved and chosen,
 1     Church of Christ for whom He died,
 1  Claim thy gifts and praise the Giver,
 1     Ye are washed and sanctified.
 1  Sanctified by God the Father,
 1     And by Jesus Christ His Son,
 1  And by God the Holy Spirit,
 1     Holy, Holy, Three in One.
 
 2  By His will He sanctifieth,
 2     By the Spirit's power within;
 2  By the loving hand that chasteneth
 2     Fruits of righteousness to win;
 2  By His truth and by His promise,
 2     By the Word, His gift unpriced,
 2  By His own blood, and by union
 2     With the risen life of Christ.
 
 3  Holiness by faith in Jesus,
 3     Not by effort of thine own,
 3  Sin's dominion crushed and broken
 3     By the power of grace alone,
 3  Christ, the holiness within thee,
 3     His own beauty on thy brow:
 3  This shall be thy pilgrim brightness,
 3     This thy blessed portion now.
 
 4  He will sanctify thee wholly;
 4     Body, spirit, soul shall be
 4  Blameless till thy Savior's coming
 4     In His glorious majesty!
 4  He hath perfected forever
 4     Those whom He hath sanctified:
 4  Spotless, glorious, and holy,
 4     Is the Church, His chosen Bride.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  I saw great throngs - each was a brother dear,
 1  Linked with each other in one Body here;
 1  Each in close union with the living Head,
 1  The witness-folk, by Jesus' Spirit led.
 
 2  At every time, in every clime I found
 2  Those, not with words of Christ, but Spirit bound.
 2  He strengthens them with might each day, each hour;
 2  Through them true works divine are wrought in power.
 
 3  This is the Church the Spirit hath begot,
 3  Elect from every people, Christ their lot.
 3  They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead;
 3  The members of this host are blessed indeed.
 
 4  And when on earth they meet His death to show,
 4  To Him their vows of love they oft renew.
 4  Some little flock will gather there or here;
 4  Christ, Head of all, to every soul most near.
 
 5  This is the temple which our Lord approves,
 5  The Church which truly honors Him and loves,
 5  Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound;
 5  She soon in glory will His throne surround.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  I have found life's Giver, and the Prince of Life;
 1  He has quenched my thirst, and vanquished all my strife.
 1  He, my living bread, became my daily meat;
 1  Death has died in me, Life's triumph is complete.
 
 2  In the Church, what glory! Far horizons glow!
 2  And His Name all radiant on each brow doth show.
 2  Christ doth breathe upon her, He's her living Rock,
 2  Shepherd of His sheep all gathered in one flock.
 
 3  There one holy flame doth burn within each breast;
 3  By one blood redeemed, in Christ they find their rest.
 3  All their thirst He quenches from one living stream;
 3  They in adoration lowly worship Him.
 
 4  There as Bread of life faint souls He ever feeds;
 4  There each hungry soul may take whate'er he needs.
 4  Lovingly He draws each soul that truly lives,
 4  And in bread and wine Himself to them He gives.
 
 5  Gone is all the earth-taint thru abounding grace;
 5  Hear the song of triumph from the ransomed race.
 5  All in glory shining, glory not their own,
 5  Blended into oneness, they approach the throne.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  The "churches" here below, so narrow bound,
 1  Reach not the hungry throngs which us surround;
 1  They run partway with truth, but miss the goal.
 1  Earth-vision blurred and dim, their eyes doth hold -
 1  But broken gleams have they of radiance gold;
 1  Too dazzling is the splendor of the whole.
 
 2  Brothers with brothers have not all one heart,
 2  In wrath they turn away and walk apart,
 2  Who from one stream of life had common birth.
 2  What fight for forms! O'er doctrines what vain strife!
 2  Instead together sharing God's one life,
 2  Who worshipped is by heaven and by earth.
 
 3  "Where is the truth?" I asked; for this I longed:
 3  None answered right 'mid all the answering throng;
 3  For ever side by side lay light and shade.
 3  "Where is," I cried, "the one communion pure?
 3  Where is the Church in which, clear-traced and sure,
 3  The Spirit's very likeness is portrayed?"
 
 4  So sought I long, and hopeless was my quest;
 4  These eyes grew dim and blind and found no rest,
 4  Till God's touch opened them, and I was freed.
 4  I found the Spirit's Church in souls made one
 4  In this, that they in troth to Christ had come -
 4  His Bride, to follow where the cross may lead.
 
 5  Thus when I see this small world's narrow thought,
 5  Behold the brother not with brother brought,
 5  Yet serving Christ - as each one deemeth right -
 5  Ah, then a voice from realms of glory calls,
 5  Where the last veil is rent and earthward falls,
 5  And where God's love, eternal, burneth bright.
 
 6  No more we put that query without end,
 6  To which self-chosen church our feet did trend -
 6  What doctrine we believed, what sacred rites.
 6  In Christ we were in bonds that nought could break;
 6  Who, by His cross and death, do all forsake,
 6  Such as were far asunder He unites.
 
 7  No longer does one heed mere formal phrase,
 7  Or seek for others' creeds through winding maze,
 7  For in Himself was truth made manifest.
 7  And out of every tongue and every land
 7  He formed one Church to meet His own demand -
 7  His Body, where His fulness is expressed.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  The Church's seed is nought by Christ Himself
 1  Sown into human hearts as life, thereby
 1  Growing as wheat, producing flour fine
 1  For bread both God and man to satisfy.
 
 2  But Satan hath the false believers sown
 2  Among the saints as tares among the wheat,
 2  To bring confusion and to hinder growth
 2  That they may not fulfill God's plan complete.
 
 3  The Church's life just as the herb must be,
 3  Grown out of Christ, who is the mustard seed;
 3  Hidden and transient, little on the earth,
 3  But good for food the hungry ones to feed.
 
 4  But Satan came and made the little herb
 4  To change its nature and to change its form,
 4  That fully grown it did a tree become
 4  Where many evil ones may lodge and swarm.
 
 5  Satan has also used the fallen "church"
 5  Evil and heathen practice to include,
 5  As leaven mingled with the meal of wheat,
 5  Thus to corrupt its purity as food.
 
 6  But Christ as life would so transform the saints
 6  That they may be as pearl and precious stone,
 6  As the materials suitable to build
 6  Into His Church to make His Kingdom known.
 
 7  Such an assembly grown in Christ as life,
 7  Transformed and built with Christ in them annealed,
 7  Is as the goodly pearl for preciousness
 7  And as the treasure hidden in the field.
 
 8  Lord, separate us from the devil's "tares,"
 8  Each on deliver from the monstrous "tree,"
 8  From all the "leaven" may Thou purify,
 8  That we may be as food to man and Thee.
 
 9  Cause us to grow in life divine each day
 9  That we may be transformed and built by Thee
 9  Into a body to express Thyself,
 9  That Thou in us Thy Church and Kingdom see.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  The unity of the Church is but
 1     The saints in oneness living;
 1  The Spirit which indwelleth them
 1     This oneness ever giving.
 1  Thus it is realized and called
 1     The unity of Spirit;
 1  'Tis based upon the common faith
 1     Which all the saints inherit.
 
 2  This precious faith of all the saints,
 2     Is constituted solely
 2  Of Christ and His redemptive work,
 2     Which are unique and holy.
 2  In this the saints are truly one,
 2     Together all agreeing,
 2  And it is from this common faith
 2     The Church came into being.
 
 3  The Church within the universe
 3     Is one as Christ's possession;
 3  The Church must therefore locally
 3     Be one in her expression;
 3  For all her elements are one -
 3     One God, one Lord, one Spirit,
 3  One faith, baptism, Body too,
 3     One hope all saints inherit.
 
 4  This oneness is the Church's ground,
 4     The ground of common standing,
 4  The only ground of unity
 4     The Spirit is demanding.
 4  The Church in actual practise thus
 4     May keep her vital union,
 4  And her expressions locally
 4     Be built up in communion.
 
 5  Lord, help us ever strive to keep
 5     This unity by taking
 5  The Church's ground of unity,
 5     The Body-life partaking,
 5  That all Thy heart's profound desire
 5     May fully be effected,
 5  And God's eternal purpose may
 5     Completely be perfected.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Christ the Son of God and His redemptive deed
 1  Are the saving faith which is our only creed.
 1  All the other doctrines do not faith comprise;
 1  Christ, His work and person, only qualifies.
 
 2  All the other teachings used improperly
 2  Are the "winds of doctrine," spoiling unity:
 2  Blowing saints away from Christ who is the Head,
 2  Building not the Body, tearing down instead.
 
 3  Thus we must relinquish doctrines of all kinds,
 3  Only keep the faith that oneness we may find.
 3  In the Lord the Spirit we are one indeed;
 3  Just to keep this oneness is our only need.
 
 4  Truth we must be holding, which is Christ Himself,
 4  That we be delivered from the sects of self,
 4  That in all things growing into Christ the Head,
 4  Built will be the Body and to fulness led.
 
 5  To the "unity of faith" we must attain,
 5  All the "winds of doctrine" evermore disdain;
 5  Holding Christ the Spirit, our reality,
 5  For the Body's growing in its unity.

 1     Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
 1  She is His new creation
 1     By water and the Word:
 1  From heav'n He came and sought her
 1     To be His holy Bride;
 1  With His own blood He bought her,
 1     And for her life He died.
 
 2  Elect from every nation,
 2     Yet one o'er all the earth,
 2  Her charter of salvation,
 2     One Lord, one faith, one birth;
 2  One holy Name she blesses,
 2     Partakes one holy food,
 2  And to one hope she presses,
 2     With every grace endued.
 
 3  'Mid toil and tribulation,
 3     And tumult of her war,
 3  She waits the consummation
 3     Of peace for evermore;
 3  Till, with the vision glorious,
 3     Her longing eyes are blest,
 3  And the great Church victorious
 3     Shall be the Church at rest.
 
 4  Yet she on earth hath union
 4     With God the Three in One,
 4  And mystic sweet communion
 4     With those whose rest is won:
 4  O happy ones and holy!
 4     Lord, give us grace that we,
 4  Like them, the meek and lowly,
 4     In love may dwell with Thee.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  The chief Cornerstone Thou art, Lord,
 1     Jewish builders did despise;
 1  God by resurrection placed Thee,
 1     Thou art precious in His eyes.
 1  Through Thee we receive salvation,
 1     And, together built by Thee,
 1  Jews and Gentiles are Thy dwelling,
 1     One new man, in harmony.
 
 2  Thou too art the smitten Rock, Lord,
 2     That man's thirst by Thee be filled,
 2  That frail man may stand upon Thee,
 2     But e'en more, God's house to build.
 2  The Foundation Stone in Zion,
 2     Tested and secure, Thou art;
 2  And the Rock, the Church supporting,
 2     Her foundation to impart.
 
 3  On Thyself the Church is builded,
 3     And though many storms assail,
 3  Still it stands erect, for 'gainst it
 3     Gates of hell cannot prevail.
 3  Thine authority possessing,
 3     It doth bind and loose in Thee,
 3  Bringing men into Thy kingdom,
 3     Satan's captives setting free.
 
 4  Living Stone of life art Thou, Lord,
 4     Precious, chosen thus to be;
 4  Living stones Thou too hast made us,
 4     One in character with Thee.
 4  Built together as a temple
 4     That our God may dwell therein,
 4  Thus we are a holy priesthood,
 4     Offering sacrifice to Him.
 
 5  Lord, Thou art the Son of David
 5     That God's temple Thou may build;
 5  King and Priest Thou art together,
 5     That Thy calling be fulfilled.
 5  As the King, for God Thou rulest,
 5     Making men submit to Him;
 5  As the Priest before God's presence,
 5     Bringing men to enter in.
 
 6  Thine authority doth issue
 6     From the throne to render peace;
 6  Fellowship is in the river
 6     To supply and give increase.
 6  When these, balanced, go together,
 6     Then God's purpose is fulfilled;
 6  King and Priest in Thee combining,
 6     Thou God's dwelling place dost build.
 
 7  Thou art God, yet flesh becamest,
 7     God with man in Thee doth dwell;
 7  Thou, the Temple for His glory,
 7     God in Thee Himself doth tell.
 7  Thus the Church too is the mingling
 7     Into one of God and man;
 7  So it is with every member
 7     For the building of God's plan.
 
 8  Thou, the everlasting Dwelling,
 8     In all ages art our home;
 8  We in Thee enjoy protection,
 8     Living in Thyself alone.
 8  Thou our Sanctuary art, Lord,
 8     We and God abide in Thee;
 8  Thou, God's presence art within us,
 8     Where we worship ceaselessly.
 
 9  Cornerstone, Foundation, Topstone,
 9     Rock, and Church, and Living Stone,
 9  Dwelling-place, and Sanctuary,
 9     Builder too art Thou, we own.
 9  Praise we give for what Thou art, Lord,
 9     As Thy wondrousness we see!
 9  Grant that we may be built up, Lord,
 9     As the living stones in Thee.

 1  On Christ, salvation rests secure;
 1  The Rock of Ages must endure;
 1  Nor can that faith be overthrown
 1  Which rest upon the "Living Stone."
 
 2  No other hope shall intervene;
 2  To Him we look, on Him we lean;
 2  Other foundations we disown,
 2  And build on Christ, the "Living Stone."
 
 3  In Him it is ordained to raise
 3  A temple to Jehovah's praise,
 3  Composed of all His saints, who own
 3  No Savior but the "Living Stone."
 
 4  View the vast building, see it rise:
 4  The work how great! The plan how wise!
 4  O wondrous fabric! Pow'r unknown:
 4  That rests it on the "Living Stone."
 
 5  But most adore His precious name:
 5  His glory and His grace proclaim!
 5  For us, the lost, condemned, undone,
 5  He gave Himself, the "Living Stone."

 1  Christ is made the sure foundation,
 1     Christ the head and cornerstone,
 1  Chosen of the Lord and precious,
 1     Binding all the Church in one;
 1  Holy Zion's help forever,
 1     And her confidence alone.
 
 2  Founded on the Lord victorious,
 2     Christ the everlasting Rock,
 2  Stands the Church in heav'nly places,
 2     Dreading not the storm or shock;
 2  Built with life divine she ever
 2     Stands against attack and mock.
 
 3  Though the gates of Hades frustrate,
 3     Yet the Church still stands for God,
 3  Overcoming evil spirits
 3     By her Lord's victorious blood;
 3  And at Christ's return in triumph
 3     All her foes will then be trod.

 1  We praise Thee, Lord, for Thy great plan
 1  That we Thy dwelling-place may be;
 1  Thou live in us, we filled with Thee,
 1  Thou in the Son expressed might be.
 
 2  Though in Thine image made by Thee
 2  And given Thine authority,
 2  Yet we are only made of clay
 2  Without a trace of divinity.
 
 3  When we receive Thee as our life,
 3  Thy nature we thru grace possess;
 3  Mingled together, we with Thee
 3  One Body glorious will express.
 
 4  When flows Thy life thru all our souls,
 4  Filling, renewing every part,
 4  We will be pearls and precious stones,
 4  Changed to Thine image, as Thou art.
 
 5  But, Lord, we fully realize
 5  These are not wrought men's praise to rouse,
 5  But as material to be built
 5  Together for Thy glorious house.
 
 6  Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;
 6  Receive us into Thy wise hands;
 6  Bend, break, and build together in Thee
 6  To be the house to meet Thy demands.
 
 7  Break all the natural life for us,
 7  Deal Thou with each peculiar way,
 7  That we no more independent be
 7  But with all saints are one for aye.
 
 8  Then we shall be Thy Bride beloved,
 8  Together in Thy chamber abide,
 8  Enjoy the fulness of Thy love.
 8  How Thou wilt then be satisfied!

 1  Thy blueprint, Lord, I treasure dear,
 1  It shows Thy tabernacle real,
 1  It tells how Thou wouldst have it built,
 1  How Thou Thy glory wouldst reveal.
 
 2  The ark's the center of the tent,
 2  The tent is but its resting-place:
 2  In it the ten commandments are,
 2  And in the tent it ever stays.
 
 3  The ark the God-man, Christ, displays -
 3  God mixed with man, as gold, wood meet;
 3  The law is God's expression full,
 3  Which dwells in Christ the Son complete.
 
 4  Thus Christ's the center of the Church,
 4  Which is to Him a resting-place;
 4  In Christ the Father ever dwells,
 4  And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.
 
 5  The tent's the increase of the ark,
 5  Both are of wood with gold o'erlaid;
 5  The Church the increase is of Christ,
 5  God blent with man here too displayed.
 
 6  The boards when joined support the tent
 6  On silver sockets standing sure;
 6  Gold overlaid, with golden rings
 6  And interlocking bars, secure.
 
 7  The Church is thus the gathered saints,
 7  On Christ's redemption standing sure;
 7  In life divine, by Spirit bound,
 7  Together built and framed secure.
 
 8  The tent's four-layered cover shows
 8  The Christ of God in every phase;
 8  God's glory thus is signified,
 8  Covering His holy dwelling-place.
 
 9  Covered by such a glorious Christ,
 9  All saints together knit may be;
 9  Enjoying all He is for them,
 9  In Him they're builded gloriously.
 
 10  The law is placed within the ark,
 10  The ark within the tent doth rest;
 10  So God in Christ within the Church
 10  His wondrous glory manifests.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Lord, Thou art a potter skilled
 1  And a glorious builder too,
 1  Molding for Thy vessel great,
 1  Building with Thy house in view.
 1  I am both a man of clay
 1  And a new-made living stone,
 1  That Thy vessel I may be
 1  And the temple Thou wouldst own.
 
 2  Though of clay Thou madest us.
 2  Thou wouldst have us be transformed;
 2  With Thy life as purest gold,
 2  Unto precious stones conformed.
 2  We shall, through Thy building work,
 2  Then become Thy loving Bride,
 2  In one Body joined to Thee,
 2  That Thy heart be satisfied.
 
 3  What Thy heart desires and loves
 3  Are not precious stones alone,
 3  But together these to build
 3  For Thy glory, for Thy home.
 3  Thou, the all-inclusive Christ,
 3  Dost a builded Church require,
 3  That Thy glorious riches may
 3  Radiate their light entire.
 
 4  Not the person spiritual
 4  In an individual way,
 4  But the corporate life expressed
 4  Will Thy heart's desire display.
 4  Members separate and detached
 4  Ne'er express Thee perfectly,
 4  But Thy Body tempered, built,
 4  Ever shall Thy fulness be.
 
 5  Build me, Lord, with other saints,
 5  Independence ne'er allow,
 5  But according to Thy plan
 5  Fitly frame and join me now.
 5  In experience not my boast,
 5  Nor in gifts would be my pride;
 5  For Thy building I give all,
 5  That Thou may be glorified.

 1  Freed from self and Adam's nature,
 1     Lord, I would be built by Thee
 1  With the saints into Thy temple,
 1     Where Thy glory we shall see.
 1  From peculiar traits deliver,
 1     From my independent ways,
 1  That a dwelling place for Thee, Lord,
 1     We will be thru all our days.
 
 2  By Thy life and by its flowing
 2     I can grow and be transformed,
 2  With the saints coordinated,
 2     Builded up, to Thee conformed;
 2  Keep the order in the Body,
 2     There to function in Thy will,
 2  Ever serving, helping others,
 2     All Thy purpose to fulfill.
 
 3  In my knowledge and experience
 3     I would not exalted be,
 3  But submitting and accepting
 3     Let the Body balance me;
 3  Holding fast the Head, and growing
 3     With His increase, in His way,
 3  By the joints and bands supplying,
 3     Knit together day by day.
 
 4  By Thy Spirit daily strengthened
 4     In the inner man with might,
 4  I would know Thy love surpassing,
 4     Know Thy breath and length and height;
 4  Ever of Thy riches taking,
 4     Unto all Thy fulness filled,
 4  Ever growing into manhood,
 4     That Thy Body Thou may build.
 
 5  In God's house and in Thy Body
 5     Builded up I long to be,
 5  That within this corporate vessel
 5     All shall then Thy glory see;
 5  That Thy Bride, the glorious city,
 5     May appear upon the earth,
 5  As a lampstand brightly beaming
 5     To express to all Thy worth.

 1  Thou art all my life, Lord,
 1     In me Thou dost live;
 1  With Thee all God's fulness
 1     Thou to me dost give.
 1  By Thy holy nature
 1     I am sanctified,
 1  By Thy resurrection,
 1     Vict'ry is supplied.
 
 2  Now Thy flowing life, Lord,
 2     Doth enlighten me,
 2  Bringing in the spirit
 2     Fellowship with Thee;
 2  All my need supplying,
 2     Making Thy demand,
 2  Leading me to cleansing
 2     And in Thee to stand.
 
 3  Thy anointing Spirit
 3     Me shall permeate,
 3  All my soul and spirit
 3     Thou wouldst saturate;
 3  Every part transforming
 3     Till conformed to Thee,
 3  Till Thy life shall bring me
 3     To maturity.
 
 4  Lord, Thy life abundant,
 4     Flowing, rich and free,
 4  Constantly refreshes
 4     And empowers me.
 4  Death by life is swallowed,
 4     Weakness is made strong,
 4  All my bonds are broken,
 4     Gloom is turned to song.
 
 5  I would give myself, Lord,
 5     Fully unto Thee,
 5  That Thy heart's desire
 5     Be fulfilled in me.
 5  I no more would struggle
 5     To myself reform,
 5  Thus in me to hinder
 5     What Thou wouldst perform.
 
 6  I would cease completely
 6     From my efforts vain,
 6  Let Thy life transform me,
 6     Full release to gain;
 6  Build me up with others
 6     Till in us Thou see
 6  Thy complete expression
 6     Glorifying Thee.

 1  But freed from self and for Thy building fit.
 
 2  Release my spirit! This is what I ask,
 2  That self-confined or closed I may not be;
 2  How deep within myself I long have been,
 2  If Thou deliver not, I'll ne'er be free.
 
 3  Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I pray,
 3  That from myself I fully may come forth;
 3  Thy Spirit then through me may freely flow,
 3  And Thou Thy presence fully may show forth.
 
 4  Release my spirit! This is what I want,
 4  That I from my seclusion may depart;
 4  My private seeking poverty has brought,
 4  Now save from self, Thy wealth to me impart.
 
 5  Release my spirit! This is what I seek,
 5  That prisoned in my self no more I'll be;
 5  By Satan's cunning cheated nevermore,
 5  But loosed from self to Thine infinity.
 
 6  Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I yearn,
 6  That self may bind my spirit nevermore;
 6  With all the saints I'd mingle in Thy life,
 6  And all Thou art enjoy forevermore.

 1  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 1     Oh, may it flow!
 1  Now I beseech Thee, Lord,
 1     Oh, may it flow!
 1  My past I would forsake,
 1  The iron walls would break,
 1  My spirit free would make;
 1     Oh, may it flow!
 
 2  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 2     Oh, may it flow!
 2  Now I implore Thee, Lord,
 2     Oh, may it flow!
 2  No more self-satisfied,
 2  No more in self-bound pride,
 2  No more my spirit tied;
 2     Oh, may it flow!
 
 3  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 3     Oh, may it flow!
 3  For this I plead with Thee,
 3     Oh, may it flow!
 3  High-minded not to be,
 3  Pride shall not prison me,
 3  I'd flow unceasingly,
 3     In spirit flow.
 
 4  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 4     Oh, may it flow!
 4  For this I seek Thee, Lord,
 4     Oh, may it flow!
 4  No more to isolate,
 4  Nor self to perfect make,
 4  My spirit nought abate,
 4     Deeply to flow.
 
 5  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 5     Oh, may it flow!
 5  I ask Thee, gracious Lord,
 5     Oh, may it flow!
 5  My trust in self o'erthrow,
 5  Down from self's throne I'll go,
 5  That living water flow
 5     In spirit, Lord.
 
 6  Oh, may my spirit flow,
 6     Oh, may it flow!
 6  Answer my prayer, dear Lord,
 6     Oh, may it flow!
 6  Not just commune with Thee,
 6  I long to builded be,
 6  Mingle with others free
 6     In spirit, Lord.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  What a blessing, what a priv'lege!
 1     Called of God a royal priest,
 1  That this glorious, holy office
 1     I should bear, though last and least.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 2  If I keep this royal calling
 2     Under Thine authority,
 2  Priestly duty thus fulfilling,
 2     Then the church will builded be.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 3  Now the church is but the priesthood;
 3     Thus the priesthood formed we need;
 3  When the priests are knit together,
 3     Then the church is built indeed.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 4  Through the church's degradation,
 4     Saints this office desolate;
 4  Through the weakness of their spirits
 4     Preaching doth predominate.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 5  Most are leaning on the message
 5     And the preaching emphasize,
 5  Yet neglect the priestly praying
 5     And their spirits' exercise.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 6  Deal with me and make me balanced,
 6     As in preaching, so in prayer;
 6  Leading others oft in praying,
 6     As Thy Word I too declare.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.
 
 7  Only serving by our praying
 7     Will our spirits mingled be;
 7  Stressing prayer as much as preaching -
 7     Thus the church is built for Thee.
 
All the building of the Body
   On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
   I this office would attend.

 1  Holy priests are living stones
 1  For God's building work today;
 1  If these stones would builded be
 1  All the priests must learn to pray.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 2  All the saints must serve as priests,
 2  That the living stones they be;
 2  Each must priestly work perform,
 2  Then their functions we will see.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 3  Tent and priests of olden times
 3  Always did together go;
 3  When the priests served in the tent,
 3  Into one the two did flow.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 4  Now the building spiritual
 4  And the priesthood all are one;
 4  Now the building of the house
 4  By the priestly work is done.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 5  In the priests the substance is
 5  Of the building work replete;
 5  When the priests their work discharge,
 5  Then God's house will be complete.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 6  Building God and man in one
 6  Is their work before the Lord;
 6  In this fellowship divine
 6  Saints are built in one accord.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 7  When in prayer our spirits blend,
 7  Then together built are we,
 7  Then a priesthood we become,
 7  Off'ring sacrifice to Thee.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.
 
 8  Grant us grace, O Lord, that we
 8  Treasure dear the priestly call;
 8  In the spirit serve and pray,
 8  That Thy church be built withal.
 
To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
Thus the building work is done.

 1  O Lord, we have loved her fair beauty,
 1     The house Thou hast chosen for Thee,
 1  The courts where Thy gladness rejoiceth,
 1     And where Thou delightest to be.
 1  We love to be made the fair dwelling
 1     Where God in His grace may abide;
 1  We'd cast forth whatever may grieve Thee,
 1     And welcome none other beside.
 
 2  O blessed the grace that has made us
 2     The home of the gladness of God,
 2  The dwelling wherein Thou delightest,
 2     The house Thou hast bought with Thy blood.
 2  'Tis there that Thy joy overfloweth,
 2     We feel it, we take of it there;
 2  By all that Thou workest within us,
 2     Thy temple is holy and fair.
 
 3  The secret of that inner chamber,
 3     Thy place is of heavenly rest;
 3  The stillness of thoughts that adore Thee,
 3     The shrine that Thou lovest the best.
 3  The temple where Christ hath His dwelling,
 3     The souls He hath ransomed, forgiv'n;
 3  The temple where I have my dwelling,
 3     Is Christ in the glory of heav'n.

 1  How lovely is Thy dwelling-place!
 1  Within Thy courts I long to be;
 1  Thy presence, Lord, my spirit craves,
 1  For this my heart cries out to Thee.
 
 2  At Thy burnt-offering altar, Lord,
 2  And at Thine incense altar blest,
 2  Even the sparrow finds a home,
 2  And swallow there prepares her nest.
 
 3  Men, as the sparrow, frail and small,
 3  When living in Thy house find rest,
 3  Relying on the altar's blood,
 3  Enjoying there the incense blest.
 
 4  How blessed are those men indeed!
 4  Trusting in Thee they are made strong;
 4  Highways to Zion in their hearts,
 4  The way they care not, rough or long.
 
 5  Passing the weeping valley they
 5  Make it a place of springing wells;
 5  The rain with blessings covers it
 5  And in the way God's mercy tells.
 
 6  From strength to strength they go, and all
 6  Before the Lord in Zion meet;
 6  Thus ever seeking Thine own self,
 6  They need Thy care and grace replete.
 
 7  Better a day within Thy courts
 7  Than days a thousand I would tell;
 7  I'd rather at Thy threshold stand
 7  Than in the wicked's tents to dwell.
 
 8  Thou art a sun, Thou art a shield,
 8  Thou grace and glory wilt supply;
 8  Thy presence and Thy very self
 8  My need in fulness satisfy.
 
 9  Not one good thing wilt Thou withhold
 9  From those who walk in uprightness;
 9  Bless'd is the man that trusts in Thee
 9  With grace and glory measureless.

 6     Bearing much in grace;
 6  Not a trace of discord,

 7  By the Spirit's flowing,
 7     We are joined in one.

 1  All praise to our redeeming Lord,
 1     Who joins us by His grace,
 1  And bids us, each to each restored,
 1     Together seek His face,
 1     Together seek His face.
 
 2  He bids us build each other up;
 2     And, gathered into one,
 2  To our high calling's glorious hope,
 2     We hand in hand go on,
 2     We hand in hand go on.
 
 3  The gift which He on one bestows,
 3     We all delight to prove;
 3  The grace through every vessel flows,
 3     In purest streams of love,
 3     In purest streams of love.
 
 4  We all partake the joy of one;
 4     The common peace we feel;
 4  A peace to worldly minds unknown,
 4     A joy unspeakable,
 4     A joy unspeakable.
 
 5  And if our fellowship below
 5     In Christ yet be so sweet,
 5  What height of rapture shall we know,
 5     When round His throne we meet,
 5     When round His throne we meet!

 1     Let party names no more
 1     The Christian world o'erspread;
 1  Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,
 1     Are one in Christ, their Head.
 
 2     Among the saints on earth
 2     Let mutual love be found;
 2  Heirs of the same inheritance,
 2     With mutual blessings crowned.
 
 3     Let envy, child of hell!
 3     Be banished far away:
 3  Those in sweet fellowship should dwell,
 3     Who the same Lord obey.
 
 4     Thus will the Church below
 4     God's purpose ever prove;
 4  Where streams of endless pleasure flow,
 4     And every heart is love.

 1     Blest be the tie that binds
 1     Our hearts in Christian love;
 1  The fellowship our spirit finds
 1     Is like to that above.
 
 2     Before our Father's throne,
 2     We pour our ardent prayers;
 2  Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one -
 2     Our comforts and our cares.
 
 3     We share our mutual woes;
 3     Our mutual burdens bear;
 3  And often of each other flows
 3     The sympathizing tear.
 
 4     When we asunder part,
 4     It gives us inward pain;
 4  But we shall still be joined in heart,
 4     And hope to meet again.
 
 5     From sorrow, toil, and pain,
 5     And sin we shall be free;
 5  And perfect love and oneness reign
 5     Through all eternity.

 1  Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
 1     There they behold Thy mercy-seat;
 1  Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
 1     With grace and mercy to abound.
 
 2  For Thou, within no walls confined,
 2     Inhabitest the humble mind;
 2  Such ever bring Thee where they come,
 2     And going, take Thee to their home.
 
 3  Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
 3     Thy former mercies here renew;
 3  Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim
 3     The sweetness of Thy saving Name.
 
 4  Here may we prove the power of prayer
 4     To strengthen faith and sweeten care;
 4  To teach our faint desires to rise,
 4     And bring Thy light before our eyes.
 
 5  Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;
 5     Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
 5  Oh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,
 5     And make our waiting hearts Thine own.
 
 6  Command Thy blessing in this hour;
 6     And as the Spirit full of pow'r
 6  With life and vision full this place,
 6     That all Thy purpose we may trace.
 
 7  O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,
 7     May nought in life or death divide
 7  The saints in Thy communion blessed,
 7     That all Thy fulness be expressed.

 1  In daily walk and in our meetings too,
 1  Christ is the center, Christ is everything;
 1  'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,
 1  But 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.
 
 2  Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,
 2  In Him we walk and by Him we are led;
 2  Christ is the living water and the food;
 2  Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.
 
 3  Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify,
 3  Christ is the life, 'tis Him we minister;
 3  Christ is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify,
 3  Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.
 
 4  Christ is the All in all to God and man -
 4  With Him both we and God are satisfied;
 4  Christ, the reality within the Church -
 4  By Him are life and numbers multiplied.
 
 5  By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,
 5  Christ the reality we would express;
 5  All the activities in fellowship -
 5  Christ thus in operation manifest.
 
 6  'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,
 6  With nothing in our mind to formalize;
 6  'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise,
 6  And with Himself in spirit exercise.
 
 7  All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,
 7  Applying Him until maturity;
 7  Let us count everything but loss for Him,
 7  For Him, our All in all, eternally.

   Let us exhibit Christ,
   Let us exhibit Christ;
We'll bring His surplus to the church
   And thus exhibit Christ.
 
 6  The center and reality,
 6     The atmosphere and ministry,

 7  The testimony and the prayer,
 7     And all the fellowship we share,
 7  The exercise of gifts, whate'er,
 7     Should just exhibit Christ.
 
   Let us exhibit Christ,
   Let us exhibit Christ;
We'll bring His surplus to the church
   And thus exhibit Christ.
 
 8  The Father we would glorify,
 8     Exalting Christ the Son, thereby
 8  The meeting's purpose satisfy
 8     That we exhibit Christ.
 
   Let us exhibit Christ,
   Let us exhibit Christ;
We'll bring His surplus to the church
   And thus exhibit Christ.

 1  In spirit and in truth, O Lord,
 1     We meet to worship here;
 1  As taught by Christ, the Son of God,
 1     We now in Him draw near.
 
 2  Thank God, He is a Spirit true,
 2     So near, so dear to us;
 2  That we may contact Him in life,
 2     In truth to worship thus.
 
 3  A spirit God has made for us
 3     That we may worship Him,
 3  Not striving, serving outwardly,
 3     But seeking from within.
 
 4  Regenerated by the Lord,
 4     Renewed in mind and heart,
 4  He dwells within us as our life
 4     True worship to impart.
 
 5  We worship here according to
 5     The inner consciousness,
 5  Anointed by His Spirit now
 5     His fulness we express.
 
 6  In truth we serve and worship too,
 6     In shadows nevermore,
 6  In Christ, the one reality,
 6     The Father we adore.
 
 7  To God we offer Christ the Lord
 7     Whom we experience;
 7  With God we too delight in Him,
 7     His light and sweetness sense.
 
 8  In spirit and reality
 8     Together here we meet,
 8  To worship, praise, and fellowship
 8     Around the mercy-seat.

 1  As members of the Body

 1  We would not be spectators
 1     But each as members move,

 1     But each our profit prove.
 
 2  As in a team we'd never
 2     Act independently,
 2  But in coordination,
 2     Each would dependent be;
 2  Not acting by our choosing

 4  In grace each trained in spirit

 1  Onward Christian soldiers!
 1     Marching as to war,
 1  With the cross of Jesus

 1  Christ, the royal Master,
 1     Leads against the foe;
 1  Forward into battle,
 1     See, His banners go!
 
Onward Christian soldiers!
   Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus

 2  At the name of Jesus
 2     Satan's host doth flee;
 2  On then, Christian soldiers,
 2     On to victory!
 2  Hell's foundations quiver
 2     At the shout of praise:
 2  Brothers, lift your voices,
 2     Loud your anthems raise!
 
Onward Christian soldiers!
   Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
   Going on before.
 
 3  Like a mighty army
 3     Moves the Church of God:
 3  Brothers, we are treading
 3     Where the saints have trod;
 3  We are not divided,
 3     All one Body we -
 3  One in faith and Spirit,
 3     One eternally.
 
Onward Christian soldiers!
   Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
   Going on before.
 
 4  Crowns and thrones may perish,
 4     Kingdoms rise and wane;
 4  But the Church of Jesus
 4     Constant will remain.
 4  Gates of hell can never
 4     'Gainst the Church prevail;
 4  We have Christ's own promise,
 4     Which can never fail.
 
Onward Christian soldiers!
   Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
   Going on before.
 
 5  Onward, then, ye people!
 5     Join our happy throng;
 5  Blend with ours your voices
 5     In the triumph song.
 5  Glory, laud and honor
 5     Unto Christ, the King;
 5  This through countless ages
 5     Men and angels sing.
 
Onward Christian soldiers!
   Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
   Going on before.

 1  Fight the good fight with all thy might!
 1  Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;
 1  Lay hold on life, and it shall be
 1  Thy joy and crown eternally.
 
 2  Run the straight race through God's good grace,
 2  Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
 2  Life with its way before us lies,
 2  Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.
 
 3  Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
 3  His boundless mercy will provide;
 3  Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove
 3  Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
 
 4  Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,
 4  He changeth not, and thou art dear;
 4  Only believe, and thou shalt see
 4  That Christ is all in all to thee.

 1  Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
 1     The conflict has begun;
 1  Thy battle song triumphant -
 1     "The victory is won!"
 1  Hell's power must be vanquished
 1     And Satan's forces strewn;
 1  The Captain of the Army
 1     Will come and triumph soon.
 
 2  Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
 2     And gaze upon thy Lord;
 2  If thou wilt fight His battle,
 2     The throne is thy reward.
 2  This war is of the spirit,
 2     Not fought on earthly ground;
 2  The Lord well knows the foe is near,
 2     Encircling us around.
 
 3  Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
 3     Christ's throne awaiteth thee;
 3  His resurrection power
 3     Will lift thy spirit free.
 3  Through Him thou wilt have power,
 3     The foe to battle down;
 3  Through Him thou wilt the triumph sing,
 3     And wear the victor's crown.
 
 4  Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
 4     Thou shalt ascend the throne;
 4  A feast He is preparing,
 4     How happy thou to own.
 4  With Him we're resurrected
 4     Above the battle din;
 4  Transcending all that binds us,
 4     We're far above in Him.
 
 5  Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
 5     Thou art the royal heir;
 5  The Lord from dust did choose thee,
 5     That thou His kingdom share.
 5  Thou hast no part in darkness,
 5     Thy future, O how bright;
 5  With Christ to dwell forever
 5     And in His love delight.
 
 6  With joyful shouts charge forward!
 6     The kingdom is before;
 6  Upon the peak of Zion
 6     We'll sing, the battle o'er.
 6  The Lamb has won the victory!
 6     The Lamb is on the throne!
 6  With shouts of joy we praise Him,
 6     For He must overcome.

 1  I dare not be defeated
 1  With Calvary in view,
 1  Where Jesus conquered Satan,
 1  Where all His foes He slew;
 1  Come, Lord, and give the vision
 1  To nerve me for the fight,
 1  Make me an overcomer
 1  Clothed with Thy Spirit's might.
 
A victor, a victor!
Because of Calvary.
Make me an overcomer,
A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.
 
 2  I dare not be defeated
 2  Since Christ, my conquering King
 2  Has called me to the battle
 2  Which He did surely win.
 2  Come, Lord, and give me courage,
 2  Thy conquering Spirit give,
 2  Make me an overcomer,
 2  In power within me live.
 
A victor, a victor!
Because of Calvary.
Make me an overcomer,
A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.
 
 3  I dare not be defeated,
 3  When Jesus leads me on
 3  To press through hellish regions
 3  To share with Him His Throne;
 3  Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier
 3  The power to wield the sword,
 3  Make me an overcomer
 3  Through Thine inerrant Word.
 
A victor, a victor!
Because of Calvary.
Make me an overcomer,
A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.
 
 4  I dare not be defeated,
 4  Just at the set of sun,
 4  When Jesus waits to whisper,
 4  "Well done, beloved, well done";
 4  Come, Lord, bend from the Glory,
 4  On me Thy Spirit cast,
 4  Make me an overcomer,
 4  A victor to the last.
 
A victor, a victor!
Because of Calvary.
Make me an overcomer,
A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.

 1  Conquering now and still to conquer,
 1     Rideth a King in His might,
 1  Leading the host of all the faithful
 1     Into the midst of the fight;
 1  See them with courage advancing,

 1  Shouting the name of their Leader,
 1     Hear them exultingly say:
 
"Not to the strong is the battle,
   Not to the swift is the race;
Yet to the true and the faithful
   Vict'ry is promised through grace."
 
 2  Conquering now and still to conquer,

 2  He is our Lord and Redeemer,
 2     Savior and Monarch divine;
 2  They are the stars that forever
 2     Bright in His kingdom will shine.
 
"Not to the strong is the battle,
   Not to the swift is the race;
Yet to the true and the faithful
   Vict'ry is promised through grace."
 
 3  Conquering now and still to conquer,
 3     Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
 3  Thrones and their scepters all shall perish,
 3     Crowns and their splendor shall fall,
 3  Yet shall the armies Thou leadest
 3     Faithful and true to the last,
 3  Find in Thy kingdom eternal
 3     Rest, when their warfare is past.
 
"Not to the strong is the battle,
   Not to the swift is the race;
Yet to the true and the faithful

 1  Encamped along the hills of light,
 1     Ye Christian soldiers rise,
 1  And press the battle ere the night
 1     Shall veil the glowing skies;
 1  Against the foe in vales below
 1     Let all our strength be hurled;
 1  Faith is the victory, we know,
 1     That overcomes the world.
 
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
O glorious victory,
That overcomes the world.
 
 2  His banner over us is love,
 2     Our sword the Word of God;
 2  We tread the road the saints before
 2     With shouts of triumph trod.
 2  By faith, they like a whirlwind's breath,
 2     Swept on o'er every field;
 2  The faith by which they conquered death
 2     Is still our shining shield.
 
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
O glorious victory,
That overcomes the world.
 
 3  On every hand the foe we find

 3  Let tents of ease be left behind,
 3     And onward to the fray.
 3  Salvation's helmet on each head,
 3     With truth all girt about,
 3  The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
 3     And echo with our shout.
 
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
O glorious victory,
That overcomes the world.
 
 4  To him that overcomes the foe,
 4     White raiment shall be giv'n;
 4  Before the angels he shall know
 4     His name confessed in heav'n;
 4  Then onward from the hills of light,
 4     Our hearts with love aflame,
 4  We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
 4     In Jesus' conqu'ring name.
 
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!

 1  The Son of God goes forth to war,
 1     A kingly crown to gain;
 1  His blood-red banner streams afar:
 1     Who follows in His train?
 1  Who best can drink his cup of woe,
 1     Triumphant over pain,
 1  Who patient bears his cross below,
 1     He follows in His train.
 
 2  The martyr first, whose eagle eye
 2     Could pierce beyond the grave,
 2  Who saw his Master in the sky,
 2     And called to Him to save:
 2  Like Him, with pardon on his tongue,
 2     In midst of mortal pain,
 2  He prayed for them that did the wrong:
 2     Who follows in his train?
 
 3  A glorious band, the chosen few
 3     On whom the Spirit came,
 3  Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
 3     And mocked the cross and flame.
 3  They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
 3     The lion's gory mane,
 3  They bowed their necks, the death to feel:
 3     Who follows in their train?
 
 4  A noble army, men and boys,
 4     The matron and the maid,
 4  Around the Savior's throne rejoice,
 4     In robes of light arrayed.
 4  They climbed by strength divine from heaven,
 4     Through peril, toil, and pain:
 4  O God, to us may grace be given
 4     To follow in their train.

 1  Fight the battle in the Body,
 1     Never fight it on your own;
 1  With the Body to the Head joined,
 1     Fight the battle on the throne.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 2  For the Body is God's armor,
 2     Not for anyone alone;
 2  When you wrestle in the Body,
 2     All its benefits you own.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 3  'Tis the Church on Christ established
 3     Satan shall not overpow'r;
 3  'Tis the Body built together
 3     Which resists the evil pow'r.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 4  In the Body, by the Headship,
 4     Sitting in the heavenlies,
 4  Struggle with the wicked spirits
 4     And the principalities.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 5  As a member of the Body,
 5     With the brethren stand for God;
 5  Praying always in the Spirit,
 5     Claim the vict'ry through the Blood.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 6  In the heav'nlies more than conqu'ror,
 6     In the power of His might,
 6  As a soldier in the army,
 6     In the Lord the battle fight.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.
 
 7  Keep on wrestling in the Body,
 7     Mighty vict'ry you will see,
 7  Bind and loose, God's will fulfilling,
 7     And the foes your food will be.
 
Fight the battle in the Body!
   By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
   Into vict'ry you'll be led.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 
 1  A mighty Fortress is our God,
 1  A Bulwark never failing;
 1  Our Helper He amid the flood
 1  Of mortal ills prevailing:
 1  For still our ancient foe
 1  Doth seek to work us woe;
 1  His craft and power are great,
 1  And, armed with cruel hate,
 1  On earth is not his equal.
 
 2  Did we in our own strength confide,
 2  Our striving would be losing;
 2  Were not the right Man on our side,
 2  The Man of God's own choosing:
 2  Dost ask who that may be?
 2  Christ Jesus, it is He;
 2  Lord Sabaoth His Name,
 2  From age to age the same,
 2  And He must win the battle.
 
 3  And though this world, with devils filled,
 3  Should threaten to undo us,
 3  We will not fear, for God hath willed
 3  His truth to triumph through us:
 3  The Prince of Darkness grim,
 3  We tremble not for him;
 3  His rage we can endure,
 3  For lo! his doom is sure,
 3  One little word shall fell him.
 
 4  That word above all earthly powers,
 4  No thanks to them, abideth;
 4  The Spirit and the gifts are ours
 4  Through Him who with us sideth:
 4  Let goods and kindred go,
 4  This mortal life also;
 4  The body they may kill:
 4  God's truth abideth still,
 4  His Kingdom is forever.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  The name of Jesus is our stand,
 1     It is our victory;
 1  Not on ourselves do we rely,
 1     But, mighty Lord, on Thee.
 1  Our weapons are not arms of flesh,
 1     But ours the Spirit's sword,
 1  And God's whole armor putting on,
 1     We battle in the Lord.
 
 2  Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,
 2     Stand firm in one accord!
 2  Though war be fierce and darkness thick,
 2     Resist him in the Lord!
 2  If one thru fear should backward turn,
 2     He undermines the rest.
 2  Oh, do not let your brothers down,
 2     Nor by you be distressed.
 
 3  The devil knows his time is short,
 3     He is the more enraged,
 3  And by his wiles would weaken us
 3     Before the battle's waged.
 3  The trials now more numerous are,
 3     The suff'ring e'en more sore,
 3  The force of hell opposing us
 3     More dreadful than before.
 
 4  What should our posture be today
 4     In such a desperate hour?
 4  Should we our ease and pleasure seek
 4     And let the foe devour?
 4  Or with increasing conflict strong,
 4     Courageous to endure?
 4  'Tis here that life or death is won!
 4     Who will God's praise secure?
 
 5  For Christ the Lord we then would stand,
 5     He is the Conqueror!
 5  For Him we would endure the pain
 5     Until the fight is o'er.
 5  The hour of triumph soon we'll see -
 5     The Lord will come again;
 5  If now we suffer for His sake,
 5     Then we with Him shall reign.

 1     Soldiers of Christ, arise,
 1     And put your armor on,
 1  Strong in the strength which God supplies,
 1     Through His eternal Son;
 1     Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
 1     And in His mighty pow'r,
 1  Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
 1     Is more than conqueror.
 
 2     Stand then in His great might,
 2     With all His strength endued;
 2  And take, to arm you for the fight,
 2     The panoply of God,
 2     That, having all things done,
 2     And all your conflicts past,
 2  Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone,
 2     And stand complete at last.
 
 3     Leave no unguarded place,
 3     No weakness of the soul,
 3  Take every virtue, every grace,
 3     And fortify the whole.
 3     To keep your armor bright
 3     Attend with constant care,
 3  Still walking in your Captain's sight
 3     And watching unto prayer.
 
 4     Pray, without ceasing pray,
 4     Your Captain gives the word;
 4  His summons cheerfully obey,
 4     And call upon the Lord:
 4     To God your every want
 4     In instant prayer display;
 4  Pray always; pray, and never faint;
 4     Pray, without ceasing pray.
 
 5     From strength to strength go on;
 5     Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
 5  Tread all the powers of darkness down
 5     And win the well-fought day:
 5     Still let the Spirit cry
 5     In all His soldiers, "Come!"
 5  Till Christ the Lord descend from high,
 5     And take the conquerors home.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1     Conflict today is fierce,
 1     The strength of Satan more;
 1  The cry of battle calling now
 1     Is louder than before.
 1     The rebel voice of hell
 1     E'en stronger now becomes;
 1  But list, the midnight cry resounds,
 1     Behold, I quickly come!
 
 2     Trials more bitter grow,
 2     The fighting doth enlarge;
 2  Hell's forces rally all their pow'rs
 2     And gather for the charge.
 2     Yet while we wait and watch
 2     And feel the war severe,
 2  We hear the joyful song ring out,
 2     Jesus, the Lord, is near!
 
 3     'Tis harder at the end
 3     The word to testify,
 3  For Satan fights with all his pow'r
 3     Our witness to defy.
 3     Much greater strength we need
 3     The foe to overcome;
 3  How happy when the Lord we see
 3     And all our sighing's done!
 
 4     Who then will forward go
 4     Strong in His mighty power?
 4  Who then will firmly trust the Lord
 4     Until the vict'ry hour;
 4     Till with the conqu'rors blest,
 4     The triumph song's begun?
 4  That man will then rejoice to hear,
 4     Behold, I quickly come!
 
 5     Who then will choose God's best,
 5     And take the narrow track,
 5  Though passing thru the wildest storms,
 5     Yet never turning back?
 5     Who now will dare press on,
 5     Enduring pain and fear?
 5  All such will then rejoice to see
 5     Jesus, the Lord, is near!
 
 6     Though deep the darkness be
 6     We still would onward go,
 6  Till we the day of rapture greet
 6     And glory 'round shall glow.
 6     'Tis there we'll see the Lord,
 6     And Satan overcome;
 6  The overcomers will rejoice,
 6     Jesus, the Lord, has come!

 8  Will you now be loyal to Him,

 2  To the work! To the work! Let the hungry be fed;

 3  To the work! To the work! In the strength of the Lord,
 3  By the pow'r of His Name, with the light of His Word,

 1  Go, labor on; spend, and be spent;
 1     Thy joy to do the Father's will;
 1  It is the way the Master went;
 1     Should not the servant tread it still?
 
 2  Go, labor on: 'tis not for nought;
 2     Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
 2  Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
 2     The Master praises, what are men?
 
 3  Go, labor on: your hands are weak,
 3     Your knees are faint, your souls cast down;
 3  Yet falter not; the prize you seek
 3     Is near, a kingdom and a crown.
 
 4  Go, labor on while it is day,
 4     The world's dark night is hastening on;
 4  Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,
 4     It is not thus that souls are won.
 
 5  Men die in darkness at your side,
 5     Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
 5  Take up the torch and wave it wide,
 5     The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.
 
 6  Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
 6     Be wise the erring soul to win;
 6  Go forth into the world's highway,
 6     Compel the wanderer to come in.
 
 7  Press on, and in thy work rejoice;
 7     For work comes rest, the prize thus won;
 7  Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice,
 7     The midnight cry, Behold, I come!

 1  Work, for the Day is coming,

 1  Jesus, the Prince, the Savior,
 1     Comes evermore to reign.
 
 2  Work, for the Day is coming,
 2     Darkness will soon be gone;
 2  Then o'er the night of weeping
 2     Day without end shall dawn,
 2  What now we sow in sadness
 2     Then we shall reap in joy;
 2  Hope will be changed to gladness,
 2     Praise be our blest employ.
 
 3  Work, for the Day is coming,
 3     Made for the saints of light;
 3  Off with the garments dreary,
 3     On with the armor bright:
 3  Soon will the strife be ended,
 3     Soon all our toils below;
 3  Not to the dark we're tending,
 3     But to the Day we go.
 
 4  Work, for the Day is coming,
 4     Children of light are we;
 4  From Jesus' bright appearing
 4     Powers of darkness flee.
 4  Out of the mist, at His bidding,
 4     Souls like the dew are born:
 4  O'er all the East are spreading
 4     Tints of the rosy morn.
 
 5  Work, then, the Day is coming,
 5     No time for sighing now;
 5  Prize for the race awaits thee,
 5     Wreaths for the victor's brow.
 5  Now morning Light is breaking,
 5     Soon will the Day appear;
 5  Night shades appall no longer,
 5     Jesus, our Lord, is near.

 1  The love of Christ constraineth;
 1     Oh, let the watchword ring
 1  Till all the world adoring
 1     To Jesus' feet it bring.
 1  Till north and south the kingdoms
 1     Shall own His glorious sway,
 1  And east and west the nations
 1     Rejoice to see His Day.
 
 2  The love of Christ constraineth;
 2     At home, abroad, where'er
 2  By sea or shore abiding
 2     His Name and mark we bear.
 2  We ask not that our service
 2     Or great or small may be,
 2  If only Thou wilt own it,
 2     Dear Lord, as unto Thee.
 
 3  The love of Christ constraineth;
 3     And we who trust His Word,
 3  Who know and feel its power
 3     To gladder service stirred,
 3  Shall neither faint nor falter,
 3     Though dark the night and long,
 3  And weak our hands that labor;
 3     His strength shall make us strong.
 
 4  The love of Christ constraineth,
 4     Then let us work and pray,
 4  And watch the glad appearing
 4     Of that triumphant day,
 4  When Father, Son, and Spirit,
 4     By every tongue confessed,
 4  All earth His broad dominion
 4     In His dear love shall rest.

 1  The work is Thine, O Christ our Lord,
 1     The cause for which we stand;
 1  And being Thine, 'twill overcome
 1     Its foe on every hand.
 1  Yet grains of wheat, before they grow,
 1  Are buried in the earth below;
 1  All that is old doth perish there
 1  To form a life both new and fair:
 1  So too are we from self and sin made free.
 
 2  Through suff'ring Thou, O Christ, didst go
 2     Unto Thy throne above,
 2  And leadest now the selfsame way
 2     Those true in faith and love;
 2  So lead us, then, though suff'rings wait,
 2  To share Thy kingdom's heav'nly state;
 2  Thy death has broken Satan's might,
 2  And leads the faithful to the light;
 2  Eternal light, from darkness into light.
 
 3  Thou hast, O Savior, led the way
 3     Through agony and death;
 3  O give, we pray, yet more and more
 3     Thy Spirit's living breath!
 3  Send messengers o'er land and sea
 3  To bring Thy children all to Thee;
 3  Thy name can save, Thy name makes free;
 3  We consecrate ourselves to Thee
 3  As servants true, as warriors brave and true.

 1  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
 1  Only to lie at His feet,
 1  A broken and emptied vessel -
 1  For the Master's use made meet!
 1  Emptied that He might fill me
 1  As forth to His service I go;
 1  Broken, that so unhindered,
 1  His life through me might flow.
 
Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Only to lie at His feet,
A broken and emptied vessel -
For the Master's use made meet!
 
 2  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
 2  Only as led by His hand -
 2  A messenger at His gateway,
 2  Only waiting for His command;
 2  Only an instrument ready
 2  His praises to sound at His will -
 2  Willing, should He not require me,
 2  In silence to wait on Him still.
 
Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Only to lie at His feet,
A broken and emptied vessel -
For the Master's use made meet!
 
 3  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
 3  Painful the humbling may be!
 3  Yet low in the dust I'd lay me
 3  That the world might my Savior see!
 3  Rather be nothing, nothing!
 3  To Him let their voices be raised!
 3  He is the fountain of blessing,
 3  He only is meet to be praised!
 
Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Only to lie at His feet,

For the Master's use made meet!

 1  Lord, how can man e'er preach Thy Word?
 1     He is brittle, crazy glass;
 1  Yet in Thy temple is conferred
 1     This glorious and transcendent place,
 1     To be window through Thy grace.
 
 2  But when Thou dost anneal Thy story
 2     In glass, Thy life to shine within
 2  The holy preachers, light of glory
 2     More radiant grows and more doth win,
 2     Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.
 
 3  The life and doctrine blent in one
 3     As light and color mingled, bring
 3  A strong regard; but speech alone
 3     Doth vanish like a flaring thing,
 3     And in the ear, not spirit ring.

 3  And in His love rejoice.
 
 4  Live Thou within us, Lord;

 4  That so our lives may teach
 4  Thy children what Thou art,
 4  And plead, by more than speech,
 4  For Thee with every heart.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  We have a most glorious King;
 1  The heavens, He says, are His throne;
 1  All worlds are His mighty domain,
 1  All kingdoms His scepter shall own.
 1  He dwells with His people below,
 1  He loves in their trials to share;
 1  We dwell with the King for His work,
 1  His burden we willingly bear.
 
 2  I'm dwelling with Jesus my King;
 2  I've found where He dwells with His own;
 2  I've opened the door of my heart;
 2  He's made it His temple and throne.
 2  Like Mary I sit at His feet,
 2  Like John I recline on His breast;
 2  His presence is fulness of joy,
 2  His bosom is infinite rest.
 
 3  I dwell with the King for His work,
 3  I've part in His glorious plan
 3  To bring in His kingdom to earth
 3  And tell His salvation to man.
 3  The world has its work and rewards,
 3  I count them but folly and loss;
 3  My business is only His work,
 3  My message is only His cross.
 
 4  I dwell with the King for His work,
 4  The work, it is His and not mine;
 4  He plans and prepares it for me
 4  And fills me with power divine.
 4  So duty is changed to delight,
 4  And prayer into praise as I sing;
 4  I dwell with my King for His work
 4  And work in the strength of my King.
 
 5  We'll dwell with the King for His work
 5  And work thru each day of the year.
 5  Perhaps ere it passes, the King
 5  In glory Himself shall appear.
 5  Oh, then in some closer embrace,
 5  Oh, then in some nobler employ
 5  We'll dwell with the King for His work
 5  In endless, ineffable joy!

 1  Not of letters, but of spirit,
 1     The New Testament way;
 1  For 'tis life the spirit giveth,
 1     But the letters always slay.
 1  Outward work God never reckons,
 1     But what's from the inmost part;
 1  It is not to serve in letter,
 1     But life's newness to impart.
 
 2  Not just by the outward teachings,
 2     But by His anointing moved;
 2  Not just by the outward pattern,
 2     But by inward vision proved.
 2  Not by human rules or rituals,
 2     But by heaven's rule within;
 2  Not by human-made decisions,
 2     But by guidance giv'n of Him.
 
 3  Not a dead religion serving,
 3     But in Christ as life to live;
 3  Not theology dispensing,
 3     But a living Christ to give.
 3  Not the knowledge of mere doctrine,
 3     But the message Christ should be;
 3  Not the gifts, the forms, the teachings,
 3     But God's Christ - reality.
 
 4  Not objectively to worship,
 4     But to serve Him inwardly;
 4  Not to preach a Christ objective,
 4     But Himself subjectively.
 4  Not just by the Scripture serving,
 4     But in spirit and in life;
 4  Not by flesh, but by the Spirit
 4     Filling, freeing from all strife.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  The overflow of life is work,
 1     The work should be our living!
 1  What we experience e'er should be
 1     The message we are giving.
 1  When living and the work are one,
 1     The work will be effectual;
 1  When message and the life are one,
 1     The word will be successful.
 
 2  The work must be the fruit of life,
 2     Born thru the Spirit's flowing;
 2  As branches of the Lord, the vine,
 2     Fruit bearing, life bestowing.
 2  'Tis Christ Himself thru us to work,
 2     Himself as life expressing,
 2  And all the riches of His life
 2     To others manifesting.
 
 3  'Tis not a movement borne of man,
 3     But by His power moving;
 3  'Tis not the deeds done outwardly,
 3     But inward action proving.
 3  'Tis not the work of enterprise,
 3     But 'tis His life confessing;
 3  'Tis not to toil for our success,
 3     But 'tis Himself expressing.
 
 4  Our plans, our aims, our energy
 4     We must abandon wholly,
 4  That He may work His plan thru us,
 4     His aim and object solely.
 4  Ourselves, with all we are and have,
 4     To death we must surrender,
 4  That Christ may live Himself thru us
 4     With riches and with splendor.

 1  O how blessed is the priest's life,
 1     Christ to him is all in all:
 1  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
 1     And His portion therewithal.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.
 
 2  All the clothing of his service
 2     Is the beauty of the Lord;
 2  Glorious splendor do his garments,
 2     Breast and shoulder-piece afford.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.
 
 3  When in sacrifice he offers
 3     Christ to God as God has willed,
 3  Then as food he doth enjoy Him
 3     And is with His riches filled.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.
 
 4  Putting on the Lord as clothing,
 4     Christ without he doth express;
 4  Eating, drinking, with Him mingled,
 4     Christ within doth him possess.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.
 
 5  Holy, glorious is their dwelling,
 5     'Tis the increase of the Lord;
 5  Here the priests built up together
 5     Unto God a house afford.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.
 
 6  All his portion, all his living,
 6     Everything the priests possess -
 6  All is Christ and Christ forever,
 6     In His all-inclusiveness.
 
O how blessed is the priest's life,
   Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
   And His portion therewithal.

 1  Christ to minister is service
 1     Both to God and others too,
 1  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
 1     Off'ring Him as service true.
 
Christ to minister is service
   Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
   Off'ring Him as service true.
 
 2  As the Israelites did offer
 2     From the surplus of their land,
 2  Thus some produce reaped of Jesus
 2     Must be in our serving hand.
 
Christ to minister is service
   Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
   Off'ring Him as service true.
 
 3  We on Christ, as land, must labor,
 3     Harvest Him for all our fare;
 3  Tasting Him to overflowing,
 3     Christ with others we may share.
 
Christ to minister is service
   Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
   Off'ring Him as service true.
 
 4  Holding Christ, as members growing,
 4     Each his function must observe;
 4  Christ receiving, Christ partaking,
 4     To His Body Christ we serve.
 
Christ to minister is service
   Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
   Off'ring Him as service true.
 
 5  Fellowship and testimony,
 5     Ministry and worship too,
 5  In all helps and ministrations
 5     Christ is all our service true.
 
Christ to minister is service
   Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
   Off'ring Him as service true.

 1  Serve and work within the Body,
 1     This the Lord doth signify;
 1  For His purpose is the Body,
 1     And with it we must comply.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 2  As the members we've been quickened
 2     Not as individuals free;
 2  We must always serve together,
 2     All related mutually.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 3  Living stones, we're built together
 3     And a house for God must be,
 3  As the holy priesthood serving,
 3     In a blessed harmony.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 4  Thus we must be built together,
 4     In position minister;
 4  For the basis of our service
 4     Is the body character.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 5  In our ministry and service,
 5     From the Body, our supply;
 5  If detached and isolated,
 5     Out of function we will die.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 6  'Tis by serving in the Body
 6     Riches of the Head we share;
 6  'Tis by functioning as members
 6     Christ's full measure we will bear.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 7  To the Head fast holding ever,
 7     That we may together grow,
 7  From the Head supplies incoming
 7     Thru us to the Body flow.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.
 
 8  Lord, anew we give our bodies;
 8     May we be transformed to prove
 8  All Thy will, to know Thy Body,
 8     And therein to serve and move.
 
Serve and work within the Body,
   Never independently;
As the members of the Body,
   Functioning relatedly.

 1  For the Church should be our service,
 1     'Tis the perfect will of God;
 1  'Tis the only way of working
 1     Which the Lord's apostles trod.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 2  For 'tis God's eternal purpose
 2     That the Church His vessel be;
 2  He intends that all our service
 2     Build His Church continually.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 3  All the gifted persons given
 3     To the Body by the Head
 3  Are to aid the Church's building,
 3     That to fulness she be led.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 4  All the gifts and all the functions,
 4     All the spirit's power shown,
 4  All the ministries are given
 4     For the Church and that alone.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 5  All the preaching of the Gospel,
 5     All the teaching ministry,
 5  Every other kind of service
 5     For the Church alone should be.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 6  Ministry is for the Churches,
 6     Not the Church for ministry;
 6  All the lampstands are the Churches,
 6     Not a form of ministry.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 7  This will keep the Church's oneness,
 7     Saving us from every sect;
 7  This will ever test our motives,
 7     And our aim will thus correct.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.
 
 8  Lord, deliver us from our work,
 8     From the work of any sect;
 8  For Thy Church alone we'd labor
 8     And its building up effect.
 
For the Church should be our service,
   Not our aims to satisfy;
This the perfect will of God is,
   And with it we must comply.

 1  From Greenland's icy mountains,
 1     From India's coral strand,
 1  Where Afric's sunny fountains
 1     Roll down their golden sand;
 1  From many an ancient river,
 1     From many a palmy plain,
 1  They call us to deliver
 1     Their land from error's chain.
 
 2  What though the spicy breezes
 2     Blow soft on Ceylon's isle;
 2  Though every prospect pleases,
 2     And only man is vile;
 2  In vain with lavish kindness
 2     The gifts of God are strown;
 2  The heathen, in his blindness,
 2     Bows down to wood and stone.
 
 3  Can we, whose souls are lighted
 3     With wisdom from on high;
 3  Can we to men benighted
 3     The lamp of life deny?
 3  Salvation! O salvation!
 3     The joyful sound proclaim,
 3  Till each remotest nation
 3     Has learned Messiah's name.
 
 4  Waft, waft, ye winds, His story;
 4     And you, ye waters, roll,
 4  Till, like a sea of glory,
 4     It spreads from pole to pole;
 4  Till o'er our ransomed nature,
 4     The Lamb for sinners slain,
 4  Redeemer, King, Creator,
 4     In bliss returns to reign.

 1  Now the Lord our souls has fed,
 1  With Himself, the Living Bread;
 1  Fed us, sitting at His feet,
 1  With the finest of the wheat.
 
 2  We have endless treasure found;
 2  We have all things and abound;
 2  Rich abundance and to spare;
 2  Shall we not the blessing share?
 
 3  For, while we are feasting here,
 3  Starving millions, far and near,
 3  Call us with the bitter cry:
 3  Come and help us, or we die.
 
 4  In this day of full increase,
 4  Shall we, can we, hold our peace?
 4  Staying here we do not well;
 4  Now then, let us go and tell:
 
 5  Tell how He hath set us free,
 5  How He leads triumphantly;
 5  How He satisfies our need;
 5  How His rest is rest indeed.
 
 6  Speak, for we, Thy servants, hear;
 6  Thou hast taught us not to fear;
 6  And whate'er Thy word shall be,
 6  We can do it, Lord, in Thee.

 1  Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling,
 1     Millions of souls forever may be lost;
 1  Who, who will go, salvation's story telling,
 1     Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?
 
"All pow'r is given unto me,
All pow'r is given unto me,
Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
And lo, I am with you alway."
 
 2  See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting:
 2     Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
 2  Christians, awake! Your forces all uniting,
 2     Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.
 
"All pow'r is given unto me,
All pow'r is given unto me,
Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
And lo, I am with you alway."
 
 3  "Why will ye die?" the voice of God is calling,
 3     "Why will ye die?" re-echo in His name:
 3  Jesus hath died to save from death appalling,
 3     Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.

Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,

 1  Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,
 1     To tell to all the world that God is Light,
 1  That He who made all nation is not willing
 1     One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
 
 2  Behold how many thousands still are lying,
 2     Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,
 2  With none to tell them of the Savior's dying
 2     Or of the life He died for them to win.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
 
 3  'Tis yours to save from peril of perdition
 3     The soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;
 3  Beware lest, slothful to fulfill your mission,
 3     You lose one jewel that should deck His crown.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
 
 4  Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation
 4     That God, in whom they move and live, is love;
 4  Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,
 4     And died on earth that men He might approve.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
 
 5  Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;
 5     Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;
 5  Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,
 5     And all you spend our Savior will repay.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.
 
 6  He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,
 6     Make known to every heart His saving grace;
 6  Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,
 6     Through your neglect unfit to see His face.
 
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

 1  Rescue the perishing,
 1     Care for the dying,
 1  Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
 1     Weep o'er the erring one,
 1     Lift up the fallen,
 1  Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.
 
Rescue the perishing,
   Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
   Jesus will save.
 
 2  Though they are slighting Him,
 2     Still He is waiting,
 2  Waiting the penitent child to receive;
 2     Plead with them earnestly,
 2     Plead with them gently;
 2  He will forgive if they only believe.
 
Rescue the perishing,
   Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
   Jesus will save.
 
 3  Down in the human heart,
 3     Crushed by the tempter,
 3  Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
 3     Touched by a loving heart,
 3     Wakened by kindness,
 3  Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.
 
Rescue the perishing,
   Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
   Jesus will save.
 
 4  Rescue the perishing,
 4     Duty demands it;
 4  Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
 4     Back to the narrow way
 4     Patiently win them;
 4  Tell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died.
 
Rescue the perishing,
   Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
   Jesus will save.

 4     All fallen ones, great or small.
 
To the lost world minister Christ,
By daily walk making Him known;
Imparting Christ by whom you live,
Share with all men what you own.

 1  Bring in the souls usurped by every sin.
 
 2  Go to collect materials for the House,
 2  Go to deliver people from the world,

 2  From the allurements Satan has unfurled.

 4  Go, Christ proclaiming, on the Body ground;
 4  Go thus in oneness with the faithful saints,
 4  And let the trumpet of the gospel sound.

 1  Along the shores of Galilee,
 1     When Christ five thousand fed,
 1  Not one was omitted
 1     In the breaking of the bread.
 1  Today they die in heathen lands,
 1     They die in want and dread,
 1  For they have been omitted
 1     In the breaking of the Bread.
 
Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
   The Living Water too;
My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
   Ready, Thy will to do."
 
 2  Long years have passed and few have heard
 2     That Jesus Christ has bled,
 2  That they might feed on Him who died
 2     To be that Living Bread.
 2  To gods of stone and wood they cry,
 2     Yet they are never fed,
 2  For they have been omitted
 2     In the breaking of the Bread.
 
Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
   The Living Water too;
My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
   Ready, Thy will to do."
 
 3  Great God, who gave Thine only Son,
 3     Help us, now Spirit-led,
 3  To tell the story of Thy love
 3     To those who ask for bread.
 3  Then gladly will we go or send,
 3     Till this blest news has spread,
 3  And they have been included
 3     In the breaking of the Bread.
 
Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
   The Living Water too;
My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
   Ready, Thy will to do."

 1  Outreach of the glorious gospel
 1     Is the flow of life within;
 1  It is by our testimony
 1     That lost sinners we may win.
 
Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
   May Thy life through us be seen;
Through us as Thy living vessels
   Quicken people from within.
 
 2  It is by the life convincing
 2     That the people may believe;
 2  It is by the life imparting
 2     That the souls may life receive.
 
Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
   May Thy life through us be seen;
Through us as Thy living vessels

 3  Always in the Lord abiding,

Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
   May Thy life through us be seen;
Through us as Thy living vessels
   Quicken people from within.
 
 4  May our living be the preaching,
 4     Making Christ to others known;
 4  Not the word of doctrine-preaching,
 4     But the seed of life be sown.
 
Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
   May Thy life through us be seen;
Through us as Thy living vessels
   Quicken people from within.

 1  Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
 1  Not one day of service give Him,
 1  Lay no trophy at His feet?
 
"Must I go, and empty-handed?"
   Must I meet my Savior so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
   Must I empty-handed go?
 
 2  Not at death I shrink nor falter,
 2  For my Savior saves me now;
 2  But to meet Him empty-handed,
 2  Thought of that now clouds my brow.
 
"Must I go, and empty-handed?"
   Must I meet my Savior so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
   Must I empty-handed go?
 
 3  O the years in sinning wasted;
 3  Could I but recall them now,

Not one soul with which to greet Him:

Not one soul with which to greet Him:

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,
 1     Should set His love upon the sons of men,
 1  Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wand'rers,
 1     To bring them back, they know not how or when.
 1  But this I know, that He was born of Mary,
 1     When Bethl'hem's manger was His only home,
 1  And that He lived at Nazareth and labored,
 1     And so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.
 
 2  I cannot tell how silently He suffered,
 2     As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
 2  Or how His heart upon the Cross was broken,
 2     The crown of pain to three and thirty years.
 2  But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
 2     And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,
 2  And lifts the burden from the heavy laden,
 2     For yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.
 
 3  I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
 3     How He will claim His earthly heritage,
 3  How satisfy the needs and aspirations
 3     Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.
 3  But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
 3     And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
 3  And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor
 3     When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.
 
 4  I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
 4     When, at His bidding, every storm is stilled,
 4  Or who can say how great the jubilation
 4     When all the hearts of men with love are filled.
 4  But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,
 4     And myriad, myriad human voices sing,
 4  And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:
 4     At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King.

 2  Lord Jesus! we remember

 2  When through Thy love's deep pity,
 2     The waves did o'er Thee roll;
 2  Baptized in death's dark waters,
 2     For us Thy blood was shed;
 2  For us Thou, Lord of Glory,
 2     Wast numbered with the dead.
 
 3  O Lord! Thou now art risen,

 4     We own with Thee we died;
 4  With Thee, our Life, we're risen,
 4     And shall be glorified.
 4  From sin, the world, and Satan,
 4     We're ransomed by Thy blood,
 4  And here would walk as strangers,
 4     Alive with Thee to God.

In death's waters I am buried,
For with Christ my Savior, I have died;
Now the world cannot pursue me,
For its power here is nullified.
I with Christ have risen too,
Out of death with Him I walk and live;
Now the Spirit life supplies
And His strength exhaustless unto me doth give.

 1  Oh, by Thy mercy and Thy grace,

 2  By baptism in Thy death we're one

 2  Thus we're forever dead to sin
 2     And from its bondage free.

 1  O day of resurrection,
 1     O day of joy and light,
 1  O seal of our redemption,
 1     Most beautiful, most bright:
 1  On thee the high and lowly,
 1     Bending before the throne,
 1  Sing "Holy, holy, holy,"
 1     To the great Three in One.
 
 2  On thee at the creation
 2     The light first had its birth;
 2  On thee, for our salvation,
 2     Christ rose from depths of earth;
 2  On thee, our Lord, victorious,
 2     The Spirit sent from heaven;
 2  And thus on thee, most glorious,
 2     A triple light was given.
 
 3  Today on weary nations
 3     The heavenly manna falls!
 3  To holy convocations
 3     The silver trumpet calls,
 3  Where gospel light is glowing
 3     With pure and radiant beams,
 3  And living water flowing
 3     With soul-refreshing streams.
 
 4  New graces ever gaining
 4     From this of days the best,
 4  We reach the rest remaining
 4     For people who are blest;
 4  To Holy Ghost be praises,
 4     To Father and to Son;
 4  The Church her voice upraises
 4     To Thee, blest Three in One.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  God's kingdom is God's reigning,
 1     His glory to maintain;
 1  It is His sovereign ruling,
 1     His order to sustain.
 1  He exercises fully
 1     His own authority
 1  Within His kingdom ever
 1     And to eternity.
 
 2  Upon the throne, the center
 2     Of government divine,
 2  God reigns, and with His purpose
 2     Brings everything in line.
 2  God's headship and His lordship
 2     He only can maintain
 2  As King within His kingdom,
 2     O'er everything to reign.
 
 3  By reigning in His kingdom
 3     God worketh all His will,
 3  And under His dominion
 3     His purpose doth fulfill.
 3  'Tis only in God's kingdom
 3     His blessing we may know;
 3  'Tis from His throne almighty
 3     The stream of life doth flow.
 
 4  Submitted to God's ruling,
 4     All virtue thus will win;
 4  Rebellion to His Headship
 4     Is but the root of sin.
 4  The evil aim of Satan -
 4     God's throne to overthrow;
 4  Our aim and goal is ever
 4     His rule to fully know.
 
 5  Within God's sovereign kingdom
 5     His Christ is magnified;
 5  When Christ in life is reigning,
 5     The Father's glorified.
 5  When God is in dominion,
 5     All things are truly blessed;
 5  When Christ for God is reigning,
 5     God's glory is expressed.
 
 6  In fulness of the seasons
 6     God's Christ will head up all,
 6  Then all will own His reigning
 6     And worship, great and small.
 6  Such reign in life and glory
 6     The Church e'en now foretastes,
 6  And to His rule submitting
 6     Unto His kingdom hastes.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  Requirements of the Kingdom are
 1  Much stricter than the law's decrees;
 1  No other requisite of God
 1  Has ever higher been than these.
 
 2  "Repent, the Kingdom has come near,"
 2  This is the Kingdom's first demand;
 2  A change of mind we all must have
 2  And on God's side must firmly stand.
 
 3  That we the Kingdom enter in,
 3  Surpassing righteousness we need,
 3  Exceeding that which is of law;
 3  From life alone it must proceed.
 
 4  That we the Kingdom enter in,
 4  We need to do the Father's will,
 4  Not by our choice to work or act
 4  But His one purpose to fulfill.
 
 5  That we the Kingdom enter in,
 5  A simple child we must become -
 5  Adjustable, obedient, meek -
 5  And everything of self o'ercome.
 
 6  The Heav'nly Kingdom e'en requires
 6  That we as God should perfect be;
 6  This standard we must fully meet
 6  That we may share its ecstasy.
 
 7  The Kingdom is the reign of God
 7  To match His nature is required;
 7  'Tis only by the life of God
 7  The Kingdom's entry is acquired.
 
 8  The Kingdom is the rule of heav'n;
 8  With heaven's state we must accord;
 8  'Tis only by the life of heav'n
 8  That we may share it with the Lord.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  The essence of the Kingdom is
 1  A life that's under heaven's rule,
 1  A life whose nature is divine
 1  With Christ experienced in full.
 
 2  Such is this life: in spirit poor,
 2  With heart repentant, mourning, meek,
 2  Which is to others merciful
 2  And purely God Himself doth seek;
 
 3  As sons of God the peace to make,
 3  For righteousness e'en suffering pain;
 3  Reviled and hurt for Jesus' sake,
 3  Exceeding joyfulness to gain;
 
 4  As salt to kill corruption rife,
 4  In darkness shining as the light,
 4  In heart and action right and true,
 4  In perfect love to claim no right.
 
 5  This life self-glory doth renounce
 5  And ever for God's kingdom prays;
 5  It trusts in God for every need
 5  And seeks His kingdom first always.
 
 6  'Tis strict with self, with others kind,
 6  And always dealing with the Lord;
 6  It ever does the Father's will
 6  And acts according to His word.
 
 7  To Satan it does not give ground,
 7  Nor to the world, or self, or sin,
 7  But seeks beneath the heaven's rule
 7  God's full authority to win.
 
 8  'Tis such a life which subjugates
 8  All things with pow'r to God's behest;
 8  The time it hastens when the Lord
 8  Will here His kingdom manifest.

 1  The Son of God has come to sow
 1  Himself, the seed of life, in man,
 1  That thru Himself God's Kingdom grow
 1  And thus fulfill th' eternal plan.
 
 2  He was the only grain of wheat
 2  Whence many grains have been produced
 2  To be the Kingdom's children meet,
 2  Thru whom God's reign is introduced.
 
 3  But Satan, enemy of God,
 3  Sowed many tares among the wheat,
 3  The Kingdom's children to confuse,
 3  And awful damage to create.
 
 4  'Tis by this subtle work of his,
 4  The mixing of the tares with wheat,
 4  The Kingdom in appearance is
 4  Abnormal and grotesquely great.
 
 5  The Kingdom should as mustard be,
 5  A little herb, yet good for food,
 5  But it has changed into a "tree,"
 5  A system of great magnitude.
 
 6  Instead of being good for food,
 6  A lodge of "birds" it has become;
 6  'Tis now a place where evil men
 6  And evil spirits make their home.
 
 7  A great religion of the world
 7  Its outward form to us reveals,
 7  Including pagan, evil things,
 7  As leaven mingled with the meal.
 
 8  A system of the world as such,
 8  It thus has changed in outward form;
 8  By evil things which it imbibes,
 8  Corruption inwardly doth swarm.
 
 9  But something hidden God doth seek,
 9  As "pearl" and "treasure in the field";
 9  As such the Lord would us transform
 9  That pearl and treasure be revealed.
 
 10  'Tis hidden from vast Christendom
 10  And from the Kingdom's great facade,
 10  Yet in its full reality
 10  'Tis transformed like to Christ and God.
 
 11  Lord, separate us from the "tares,"
 11  And save us from the monstrous "tree";
 11  From all the "leaven" purge us now
 11  That we may purely be of Thee.
 
 12  May Thou in life transform our souls
 12  That we as precious stones may be,
 12  Meet for Thy house to build and in
 12  Thy Kingdom's full reality.

 1  Lo, the glory! Lo, the splendor!
 1     Heaven's Kingdom manifest!
 1  And its glorious King, our Master,
 1     Is by God's appointment blest.
 1  Once in flesh He came so lowly,
 1     Hated and despised by man;
 1  Now He comes again in glory
 1     To fulfill the Kingdom plan.
 
 2  Going to receive the Kingdom
 2     From His God, the Ancient of Days,
 2  Now He cometh with the Kingdom
 2     And its glorious, ruling rays.
 2  He's "the Stone" which breaks the nations
 2     Into pieces lowliest,
 2  Which "a mountain great" becometh
 2     As the Kingdom manifest.
 
 3  Lo, the earth, all lands and kingdoms,
 3     By the Lord and Christ possessed;
 3  Earth beneath their sovereign ruling
 3     Will be full of peace and rest.
 3  No more war and no more hatred
 3     'Twixt the nations will there be;
 3  But God's knowledge shall suffuse them
 3     As the waters fill the sea.
 
 4  All the Christian overcomers
 4     Shall with Christ in glory reign,
 4  And the remnant saved of Israel
 4     Then God's priesthood shall obtain.
 4  As God's people shall the nations
 4     'Neath their rule and teaching be,
 4  And a glorious restoration
 4     All creation then shall see.
 
 5  Satan will be bound and banished;
 5     From his rule will earth be freed;
 5  With Christ's sovereign reign and headship
 5     Earth will then be blessed indeed.
 5  All to Christ will then be subject,
 5     To His pow'r and to His will;
 5  As the Head and Center glorious,
 5     He God's purpose will fulfill.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  God's Kingdom today is a real exercise,
 1  But when Christ comes to reign it will be a great prize;
 1  It is wisdom divine that we now may be trained
 1  That His plan be fulfilled and His justice maintained.
 
 2  God's children, we're born to be kings with His Son,
 2  And we need to be trained that we may overcome
 2  And to know how to rule in His kingdom as kings,
 2  That His kingship thru us be expressed o'er all things.
 
 3  Today we must learn to submit to His throne,
 3  How to have a strict life and His government own;
 3  His authority then we'll be able to share,
 3  O'er the nations to rule with God's Son as the heir.
 
 4  With a life strict to self we must righteousness hold,
 4  Kind to others in peace, and with God joyful, bold;
 4  In the Kingdom's reality e'er to remain,
 4  For its manifestation prepared thus to reign.
 
 5  Then Christ when He comes with the kingdom from God
 5  Will to us grant His kingship to share as reward;
 5  Thus the Lord will His righteousness thru us maintain
 5  And His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.
 
 6  For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost,
 6  For the Kingdom assured that he would not be lost;
 6  'Tis for this he charged others, Be true to the Lord,
 6  That the Kingdom might be unto them a reward.
 
 7  O Lord, give us grace for Thy Kingdom to live,
 7  To be trained that Thou may the reward to us give;
 7  Make the Kingdom's reality our exercise,
 7  That its manifestation may be our great prize.

 2  Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
 2  Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.
 
 3  Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest
 3  Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
 3  That love that gives not as the world, but shares
 3  All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.
 
 4  Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete
 4  In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet;
 4  All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,
 4  Object supreme of all, by all adored.

 1  Christ is coming! Let creation
 1  From her groans and travail cease,
 1  Let the glorious proclamation
 1  Hope restore, and faith increase.
 1  Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 1  Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace.
 
 2  Earth can now but tell the story
 2  Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
 2  She shall yet behold Thy glory
 2  When Thou comest back to reign.
 2  Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 2  Let each heart repeat the strain.
 
 3  Long Thy people have been pining
 3  For Thy peace and rest, and Thee,
 3  Soon, in heav'nly glory shining,
 3  Their Restorer shall they see,
 3  Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 3  Haste the joyous jubilee.
 
 4  With that blessed hope before us,
 4  Let no harp remain unstrung;
 4  Let the mighty advent chorus
 4  Onward roll on every tongue.
 4  Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 4  Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come.

 1  A lamp in the night, a song in time of sorrow,
 1     A great glad hope which faith can ever borrow
 1  To gild the passing day with the glory of the morrow,
 1     Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
Blessed hope, blessed hope,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
   How the aching heart it cheers;
   How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
 2  A star in the sky, a beacon bright to guide us;
 2     An anchor sure to hold when storms betide us;
 2  A refuge for the soul, where in quiet we may hide us,
 2     Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
Blessed hope, blessed hope,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
   How the aching heart it cheers;
   How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
 3  A call of command, like trumpet clearly sounding,
 3     To make us bold when evil is surrounding;
 3  To stir the sluggish heart, and to keep in good abounding,
 3     Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
Blessed hope, blessed hope,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
   How the aching heart it cheers;
   How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
 4  A word from the One to all our hearts the dearest,
 4     A parting word to make Him aye the nearest;
 4  Of all His precious words, the sweetest, brightest, clearest,
 4     Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.
 
Blessed hope, blessed hope,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
   How the aching heart it cheers;
   How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.

 1  Our Lord is now rejected,
 1     And by the world disowned,
 1  By the many still neglected,
 1     And by the few enthroned;
 1  But soon He'll come in glory!
 1     The hour is drawing nigh,
 1  For the crowning day is coming
 1        By-and-by.
 
O the crowning day is coming,
   Is coming by-and-by,
When our Lord shall come in power
   And glory from on high.
O the glorious sight will gladden
   Each waiting, watchful eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
      By-and-by.
 
 2  The heavens shall glow with splendor,
 2     But brighter far than they,
 2  The saints shall shine in glory,
 2     As Christ shall them array.
 2  The beauty of the Savior
 2     Shall dazzle every eye,
 2  In the crowning day that's coming
 2        By-and-by.
 
O the crowning day is coming,
   Is coming by-and-by,
When our Lord shall come in power
   And glory from on high.
O the glorious sight will gladden
   Each waiting, watchful eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
      By-and-by.
 
 3  Our pain shall then be over,
 3     We'll sin and sigh no more,
 3  Behind us all of sorrow,
 3     And naught but joy before,
 3  A joy in our Redeemer,
 3     As we to Him are nigh,
 3  In the crowning day that's coming
 3        By-and-by.
 
O the crowning day is coming,
   Is coming by-and-by,
When our Lord shall come in power
   And glory from on high.
O the glorious sight will gladden
   Each waiting, watchful eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
      By-and-by.
 
 4  Let all that look for hasten
 4     The coming joyful day,
 4  By earnest consecration,
 4     To walk the narrow way;
 4  By gathering in the lost ones,
 4     For whom our Lord did die,
 4  For the crowning day that's coming
 4        By-and-by.
 
O the crowning day is coming,
   Is coming by-and-by,
When our Lord shall come in power
   And glory from on high.
O the glorious sight will gladden
   Each waiting, watchful eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
      By-and-by.

 1  There's a light upon the mountains,
 1     and the day is at the spring,
 1  When our eyes shall see the beauty
 1     and the glory of the King;
 1  Weary was our heart with waiting,
 1     and the night-watch seemed so long,
 1  But His triumph-day is breaking, and
 1     we hail it with a song.
 
 2  In the fading of the starlight we can
 2     see the coming morn;
 2  And the lights of men are paling in
 2     the splendors of the dawn;
 2  For the eastern skies are glowing as
 2     with lights of hidden fire,
 2  And the hearts of men are stirring
 2     with the throb of deep desire.
 
 3  There's a hush of expectation, and
 3     a quiet in the air;
 3  And the breath of God is moving in
 3     the fervent breath of prayer;
 3  For the suffering,
 3     dying Jesus is the Christ upon the throne,
 3  And the travail of our spirit is the
 3     travail of His own.
 
 4  He is breaking down the barriers,
 4     He is casting up the way;
 4  He is calling for His angels to build
 4     up the gates of day;
 4  But His angels here are human, not
 4     the shining hosts above,
 4  For the drum-beats of His army are
 4     the heart-beats of our love.
 
 5  Hark! we hear a distant music, and
 5     it comes with fuller swell;
 5  'Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of
 5     our King Emmanuel;
 5  Zion, go ye forth to meet Him,
 5     and my soul, be swift to bring
 5  All thy sweetest and thy dearest for
 5     the triumph of our King.

 1  In the advent light, O Savior,
 1  I am living day by day;
 1  Waiting, working, watching ever,
 1  Knowing Thou art on Thy way.
 
 2  Separated unto Jesus,
 2  Loosed from all the world beside;
 2  Blinded by the advent glory,
 2  Hour by hour would I abide.
 
 3  So from glory unto glory,
 3  Gladdened by the advent ray;
 3  All the path is growing brighter,
 3  Shining unto perfect day.
 
 4  In the advent light to witness
 4  To a dark and dying world;
 4  This the holy ordination;
 4  May His banner be unfurled.
 
 5  In the advent light rejoicing;
 5  Songs of praise along the road
 5  Seem to make the journey shorter,
 5  Mounting upward to our God.
 
 6  He is coming! He is coming!
 6  Pass the heavenly watchword on:
 6  Go ye forth to meet the Bridegroom,
 6  Hail! to God's anointed Son.
 
 7  See the advent glory breaking;
 7  Faith will soon be lost in sight;
 7  Face to face I shall behold Him,
 7  Bathed in His eternal light.

 1  Soon our Lord will come, the day is drawing nigh,

 1     That the Lord our hearts with rapture cheer.
 
Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
Singing all His praise with glad accord.
 
 2  Soon our Lord will come, the Morning Star appear;

 2  Never with the current of the age we go,

Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
Singing all His praise with glad accord.
 
 3  Soon our Lord will come His servants to reward;
 3     Those who love Him then the crown will share.
 3  Watchful we must be and treasure not the world,
 3     Love and serve the Lord, His burden bear.
 
Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
Singing all His praise with glad accord.
 
 4  Soon our Lord will come and in His kingdom reign;
 4     Satan will be bound, the world subdued.
 4  We must fight the battle, overcome the foe,
 4     On His throne He then will us include.
 
Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
Singing all His praise with glad accord.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Since long ago at Bethany we parted,
 1  Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
 1  How can I take my harp down from the willow?
 1  How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
 1  And when at night I'm keeping lonely vigil -
 1  Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer -
 1  Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,
 1  But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?
 
 2  Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
 2  Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
 2  Thy coming bids me seek a better country,
 2  For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
 2  Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,
 2  My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
 2  Since Thou art gone the sense of void o'erwhelms me.
 2  Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.
 
 3  Though even now I know Thy loving presence,
 3  Yet in my heart there's still a sense of lack.
 3  Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
 3  Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
 3  Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;
 3  Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;
 3  When I feel most content, the silent yearning
 3  To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.
 
 4  What exile cannot but desire his homeland
 4  And long his people once again to greet?
 4  What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
 4  What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
 4  O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures
 4  With all the joy of Thy return compare?
 4  Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,
 4  What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?
 
 5  Could'st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise
 5  Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
 5  Yet day by day and year by year I've waited
 5  And still I wait, and no return I see!
 5  Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting
 5  While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
 5  How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer
 5  Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?
 
 6  From generation unto generation
 6  Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen
 6  Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.
 6  How long, how very long the time has been!
 6  Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?
 6  Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
 6  Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further
 6  Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?
 
 7  Lord, I recall the many years I've waited
 7  For Thy return - yet, Lord, not I alone,
 7  But Thy dear saints through many generations -
 7  Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
 7  To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,
 7  By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
 7  Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,
 7  Come, come and answer now this mighty corp'rate cry!

 1  Since Thy departure from Olivet's Mountain,
 1     Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
 1  Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
 1     Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we've prayed?
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 2  Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
 2     Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
 2  Often in praying and often in watching,
 2     In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 3  Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
 3     Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
 3  All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
 3     For I am longing for Thy loving face.
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 4  Lord, we're impatient awaiting Thy coming,
 4     We do not know how much longer 'twill be;
 4  From every sunrise to every bright sunset
 4     Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 5  Whene'er 'tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
 5     Whene'er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
 5  We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
 5     How disappointed when no sign of Thee!
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 6  If it were not for the bidding Thou gav'st us,
 6     We'd be discouraged, Thy service we'd shirk;
 6  But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
 6     For Thee to live and in diligence work.
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.
 
 7  Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
 7     Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
 7  We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
 7     That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e'en today?
 
Come Thou, come now:
Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
All our desire is Thy promised returning,
Oh, may Thou quickly return.

 1  My King will soon come back again,
 1     The sky be filled with Him;
 1  The universe to be redeemed
 1     Will see His light therein.
 1  The Lord will soon fulfill His plan,
 1     His footsteps now I hear;
 1  His glorious frame I faintly see
 1     Beginning to appear.
 
 2  I'm longing for His presence blest
 2     And dare not slothful be
 2  While waiting for my Lord's return,
 2     His own dear self to see.
 2  My only hope - that He may come
 2     And change my faith to sight;
 2  There is no other joy on earth
 2     Which gives my heart delight.
 
 3  My heart is always with Himself,
 3     My eyes are heavenward,
 3  My lips would utter nothing else
 3     Than meeting with my Lord.
 3  The coming of the Lord draws nigh,
 3     His coming is for me;
 3  His promise ever standeth firm
 3     And soon fulfilled I'll see.
 
 4  My Savior, all Thy holy words
 4     Can never doubted be;
 4  With them encouraged day by day,
 4     I'm faithful unto Thee.
 4  Oh, may Thy glory soon appear,
 4     The foe be overthrown;
 4  Thy promises be realized,
 4     And we brought to Thy throne.
 
 5  Thy saving arm a refuge is,
 5     My Savior God, to me;
 5  Thou as the father keepeth them
 5     Who put their trust in Thee.
 5  The sheep and shepherd are of one,
 5     The head and body same;
 5  None e'er can pluck from out Thy hand
 5     The child who trusts Thy Name.
 
 6  A thousand hands won't hinder me,
 6     Nor will ten thousand eyes;
 6  The thorns upon the road but help
 6     Me onward to the prize.
 6  Arise, my spirit and my heart,
 6     And let the world go by;
 6  The Lord of life will take me soon
 6     To be with Him on high.
 
 7  Thou healing sun! Thou hope of man!
 7     I really love Thy ray.
 7  Oh, righteous Lord! Oh, glorious King!
 7     I bow to Thee and pray:
 7  Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne
 7     And quickly show Thy face;
 7  Thy heav'nly kingdom may Thou found
 7     And grant all men Thy grace.
 
 8  The truth should triumph and be king,
 8     And freedom should be queen;
 8  But falsehood, which has rampant run,
 8     Head of the world is seen.
 8  We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come
 8     And bring Thy light from heav'n;
 8  The foe be crushed and all Thy sons
 8     Into Thy bosom giv'n.

 1     The Church has waited long,

 1     Age after age had gone,
 1     Sun after sun has set,
 1  And still in weeds of widowhood,
 1     She weeps a mourner yet.
 
 2     Saint after saint on earth
 2     Has lived, and loved, and died;
 2  And as they left us one by one,
 2     We laid them side by side;
 2     We laid them down to sleep,
 2     But not in hope forlorn;
 2  We laid them but to ripen there,
 2     Till the last glorious morn.
 
 3     The serpent's brood increase,
 3     The powers of hell grow bold,
 3  The conflict thickens, faith is low,
 3     And love is waxing cold.
 3     How long, O Lord our God,
 3     Holy, and true, and good,
 3  Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering Church,
 3     Her sighs, and tears, and blood?
 
 4     We long to hear Thy voice,
 4     To see Thee face to face,
 4  To share Thy crown and glory then,
 4     As now we share Thy grace.
 4     Should not the loving bride
 4     Her absent bridegroom mourn?
 4  Should she not wear the signs of grief
 4     Until her Lord return?
 
 5     The whole creation groans,
 5     And waits to hear that voice
 5  That shall her beauteousness restore,
 5     And make her wastes rejoice.
 5     Come, Lord, and wipe away
 5     The curse, the sin, the stain,
 5  And make this blighted world of ours
 5     Thine own fair world again.

Oh, how long before my Lord comes back,
   My heart desires to see Thy face,
That the song of triumph I may sing
   And behold my Beloved, full of grace.
Come quickly, Lord, and tarry not!
   Oh, when wilt Thou return to comfort me;
Come quickly, Lord and tarry not!
   My heart desires to be with Thee.

 1  Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
 1  Face to face - what will it be?
 1  When with rapture I behold Him,
 1  Jesus Christ who died for me.
 
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
 
 2  Only faintly now, I see Him,
 2  With the darkling veil between,
 2  But a blessed day is coming,
 2  When His glory shall be seen.
 
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
 
 3  What rejoicing in His presence,
 3  When are banished grief and pain;
 3  When the crooked ways are straightened,
 3  And the dark things shall be plain.
 
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!
 
 4  Face to face! O blissful moment!
 4  Face to face - to see and know;
 4  Face to face with my Redeemer,
 4  Jesus Christ who loves me so.
 
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!

 1  'Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow,
 1     One bright gleam I see;
 1  Well I know the blessed morrow
 1     Christ will come for me.
 1  'Midst the peace, the joy, the glory
 1     And the light, God's own,
 1  Christ for me is watching, waiting,
 1     Waiting 'til I come.
 
 2  Long the blessed Guide has led me,
 2     By the desert road;
 2  Now I see the coming splendor,
 2     Splendor of my God.
 2  There amidst the love and glory
 2     He is waiting yet;
 2  On His hands a name is graven
 2     He can ne'er forget.
 
 3  Who is this, who comes to meet me,
 3     On the desert way,
 3  As the Morning Star foretelling
 3     God's unclouded day?
 3  He it is who came to win me,
 3     On the cross of shame;
 3  In His glory well I know Him,
 3     Evermore the same.
 
 4  O the blessed joy of meeting,
 4     All the desert past;
 4  O the wondrous words of greeting,
 4     He shall speak at last!
 4  He and I together ent'ring
 4     The fair realm above;
 4  He and I together sharing
 4     All the Father's love.
 
 5  Where no shade nor stain can enter,
 5     Nor the gold be dim,
 5  In His holiness unsullied,
 5     I shall walk with Him.
 5  Meet companion then for Jesus,
 5     From Him, for Him, made -
 5  Glory of God's grace forever
 5     There in me displayed.
 
 6  He who in His hour of sorrow
 6     Bore the curse alone;
 6  I who through the lonely desert
 6     Trod where He had gone;
 6  He and I, in that bright glory,
 6     One deep joy shall share -
 6  Mine, to be forever with Him;
 6     His, that I am there.

 1  Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
 1     Great David's greater Son!
 1  Hail, in the time appointed,
 1     His reign on earth begun!
 1  He comes to break oppression,
 1     To set the captive free;
 1  To take away transgression,
 1     And rule in equity.
 
 2  He shall come down like showers
 2     Upon the fruitful earth;
 2  And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
 2     Spring in His path to birth:
 2  Before Him on the mountains
 2     Shall peace, the herald, go;
 2  And righteousness, in fountains,
 2     From hill to valley flow.
 
 3  Kings shall fall down before Him,
 3     And gold and incense bring;
 3  All nations shall adore Him,
 3     His praise all people sing;
 3  For He shall have dominion
 3     O'er river, sea, and shore,
 3  Far as the eagle's pinion,
 3     Or dove's light wing can soar.
 
 4  To Him shall prayer unceasing
 4     And daily vows ascend;
 4  His kingdom still increasing,
 4     A kingdom without end.
 4  The mountain dews shall nourish
 4     A seed in weakness sown,
 4  Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,
 4     And shake like Lebanon.
 
 5  O'er every foe victorious
 5     He on His throne shall rest,
 5  From age to age more glorious,
 5     All-blessing and all-blest.
 5  The tide of time shall never
 5     His covenant remove;
 5  His Name shall stand forever,
 5     His changeless Name of Love.

 1  For the glorious revelation

 1  All the creatures wait, expecting,

 2  All creation groans together,

 3  We are growing to adoption,
 3     With Christ in conformity.
 
 4  'Tis for this the Spirit groaneth,
 4     That to Christ we be conformed;
 4  All things also work together,
 4     That in life we be transformed.
 
 5  God will bring us into glory,
 5     We will then be glorified;
 5  Fully saturated with Him,
 5     We'll be wholly sanctified.
 
 6  To the freedom of this glory,
 6     All creation will be freed;
 6  With the kid shall lie the leopard,
 6     And the cow with bear shall feed.
 
 7  Heirs with Christ in full adoption,
 7     We'll His heritage possess,
 7  Glorified with Him as brethren,
 7     God's full glory we'll express.

 1  God's eternal purpose
 1     Is to join with man,
 1  Causing man, His vessel,
 1     To be born again,
 1  His own life imparting,
 1     Filling to the brim;
 1  Man may thus express Him,
 1     And be one with Him.
 
 2  God in His own image
 2     Hath created man,
 2  That he may be able
 2     To fulfill His plan;
 2  That he may receive Him
 2     As the tree of life
 2  To become His fulness
 2     As to man the wife.
 
 3  In His life's rich flowing
 3     Man will be transformed
 3  Into precious substance
 3     And to Him conformed.
 3  Thus will man be builded
 3     As His counterpart,
 3  Thus to be His dwelling,
 3     Satisfy His heart.
 
 4  'Tis the holy city,
 4     New Jerusalem;
 4  With His saints God mingles,
 4     Makes His home with them.
 4  He becomes their content,
 4     His expression they;
 4  They shall share His glory,
 4     One with Him for aye.
 
 5  He's the very center,
 5     Ruling on the throne;
 5  By His life the power,
 5     Saints are kept in one.
 5  By His light of glory,
 5     They are kept in light,
 5  Harmony enjoying
 5     In divine delight.
 
 6  He's their living water,
 6     And their food supply;
 6  All their thirst and hunger
 6     He doth satisfy.
 6  He's for them the temple,
 6     In Himself they live,
 6  In His constant presence
 6     Worship ever give.

 1  Lo, the central thought of God

 1  He to man is everything
 1  That He might fulfill His plan.
 
 2  Earthen vessel man was made -

 2  God as life that he may take
 2  And with Him have oneness true.
 
 3  By the flow of life divine,
 3  Man becomes a precious stone
 3  Fit for building God's abode,
 3  That His glory might be known.
 
 4  'Tis the city God hath built,
 4  'Tis the dwelling God requires,
 4  'Tis the new Jerusalem
 4  Which fulfills His heart's desires.
 
 5  'Tis the building of the saints,
 5  'Tis the blend of God and man,
 5  Purposed by the Father's will
 5  Long before the world began.
 
 6  In its center, as its pow'r,
 6  Is the throne of Christ and God,
 6  Whence doth flow the stream of life
 6  As the Spirit's living flood.
 
 7  Christ, the tree of life, is there
 7  In the flowing of the stream,
 7  Yielding fruit of life divine
 7  As the food of life supreme.
 
 8  God in Christ, the glorious light,
 8  Thru the city brightly shines,
 8  Scattering all the deathly night
 8  With its light of life divine.
 
 9  God in man and man in God
 9  Mutual dwelling thus possess;
 9  God the content is to man,
 9  And the man doth God express.

 2  Shall have the right to share the bliss with God.
 
 3  And every time we toward that city gaze,

 3  With Thee to share Thy God eternally,
 3  With Thee to share Thy God eternally.

 5  Come! Bring us to that city from on high!
 5  That in that glory we may share with Thee,
 5  Thy loving Self partake eternally,
 5  Thy loving Self partake eternally.
 
 6  O Lord, Thou sayest, "I make all things new,"
 6  New heav'ns, new earth, and all within them too!
 6  Our God Himself our portion then shall be;
 6  O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee,
 6  O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee.

 1  He looked for a city and lived in a tent,
 1  A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;
 1  God's promise his solace, so royal his birth,
 1  No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.
 
City! O city fair!
God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.
 
 2  He looked for a city, his God should prepare;
 2  No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,
 2  For had not God told him, that royal abode
 2  Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.
 
City! O city fair!
God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.
 
 3  He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed
 3  To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,
 3  The thought of that city changed sighing to song,
 3  For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.
 
City! O city fair!
God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.
 
 4  He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share
 4  And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare
 4  Is ever our portion, since willing to be
 4  Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.
 
City! O city fair!
God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.

 1  It was a garden in the primal age,
 1  But at the end it is a city square;
 1  Creation's center in the garden was,
 1  God's building issues in the city fair.
 
 2  Both in the garden and the city fair
 2  A river and the tree of life are seen,
 2  Christ typifying as the life supply,
 2  The Spirit showing as the living stream.
 
 3  Both in the garden and the city bright
 3  Three kinds of precious substances are found;
 3  There are the gold, the pearls, and precious stones
 3  Which for the building work of God abound.
 
 4  But in the garden all these precious things
 4  Are just materials lying in the earth,
 4  Yet in the city all are builded up
 4  And form that dwelling of transcendent worth.
 
 5  Man in the garden of the clay was formed,
 5  In nature as the Lord created him;
 5  The tree of life was then without the man,
 5  Not having yet become his life within.
 
 6  But in the city glorious the tree
 6  Within the corporate "man" doth grow, thereby
 6  Revealing Christ Himself as life divine
 6  Being to man his inward life supply.
 
 7  'Tis for the city man is wrought upon,
 7  Therefore regenerated and transformed
 7  To purest gold, to pearls and precious stones,
 7  As Christ's own Body, to Himself conformed.
 
 8  Within the garden also was a bride,
 8  Who was to Adam as his counterpart;
 8  Lastly, the city is itself the bride
 8  As Christ's own fulness, precious to His heart.
 
 9  The city is God's building work replete,
 9  A composition of the justified;
 9  A habitation it affords to God
 9  And is to Christ His own beloved bride.
 
 10  'Tis God's expression, ultimate and full,
 10  Corporate and universal, marvelous;
 10  God's glory it completely manifests,
 10  And is Christ's counterpart most glorious.

 4  'Tis their mutual habitation,
 4     Goal of God's eternal plan.
 
Lo, the holy city,
Full of God's bright glory!
It is God's complete expression
In humanity.

 1  Glorious things of thee are spoken,
 1     Holy city of our God;
 1  He whose word cannot be broken
 1     Formed thee for His own abode;
 1  On the Rock of Ages founded,
 1     What can shake thy sure repose?
 1  With salvation's walls surrounded,
 1     Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.
 
 2  See the streams of living waters,
 2     Springing from eternal love,
 2  Well supply thy blessed members,
 2     And all fear of want remove;
 2  Who can faint, when such a river
 2     Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?
 2  Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
 2     Never fails from age to age.
 
 3  Blest constituents of Zion,
 3     Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
 3  Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
 3     Makes them kings and priest to God.
 3  'Tis His love His people raises
 3     Over self to reign as kings:
 3  And as priests, His worthy praises,
 3     Each his thankful offering brings.
 
 4  Savior, if of Zion's city
 4     I, through grace, a member am,
 4  Let the world deride or pity -
 4     I will glory in Thy name.
 4  Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
 4     All his boasted pomp and show;
 4  Solid joys and lasting treasure
 4     None but Zion's members know.

 1  How glorious, how bright it shines,
 1  The holy, new Jerusalem;
 1  It is God's dwelling place with man,
 1  The spotless bride of Christ, the Lamb.
 
 2  Saints of the Old and of the New,
 2  Heirs of the promise God bestowed,
 2  Components of the city are,
 2  Together built for God's abode.
 
 3  Perfectly square the city lies,
 3  All sides are equal - length, width, height;
 3  No measurement more long or short,
 3  No part oblique, it stands upright.
 
 4  The city with its street pure gold
 4  As clear as glass transparent is,
 4  Showing that God's transcendent life
 4  Its quality and nature is.
 
 5  Twelve city gates are each one pearl;
 5  Thus man is through redemption shown
 5  Reborn and as a pearl transformed,
 5  Entering to a realm God's own.
 
 6  The twelve foundations of its wall
 6  Are with twelve precious stones adorned;
 6  Through fire and pressure recomposed
 6  And with eternal value formed.
 
 7  The wall of jasper, crystal clear,
 7  God's glory by it fully shown;
 7  His glorious light through it does shine,
 7  And He appears as jasper stone.
 
 8  The wall a separation makes,
 8  Excluding all that is unclean;
 8  Gold, pearls, and precious stones alone
 8  The holy city has within.
 
 9  God and the Lamb the Temple are!
 9  We shall behold His glorious face;
 9  His presence never will depart,
 9  We'll worship Him thru endless days.
 
 10  The city needs no sun nor moon
 10  For God's own glory is its light;
 10  The Lamb's the lamp the city bears,
 10  In all directions blazing bright.
 
 11  Out from the throne of God and the Lamb
 11  Flows midst the street a living stream,
 11  And on its banks, on either side,
 11  The tree of life is thriving seen.
 
 12  This signifies the life of God
 12  Not just for food or water flows,
 12  But carries God's authority
 12  As it throughout the city goes.
 
 13  The street of purest gold therein
 13  God's nature as the way doth show;
 13  A river in it flows for drink
 13  And fruits of life abundant grow.
 
 14  The number twelve means government,
 14  Perfection which eternal is;
 14  God blent with man it also tells -
 14  Three multiplied by four shows this.
 
 15  Darkness and death shall be no more,
 15  Sorrow and pain shall pass away,
 15  Old will be gone and all be new,
 15  God will abide with man for aye.
 
 16  The city has God's image full,
 16  It rules for Him, the sovereign King,
 16  Fulfilling His eternal plan,
 16  Complete content to Him to bring.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  Throughout the whole of Holy Writ
 1  The saints in type are manifest
 1  As like a bride, God's heart to please,
 1  And as a building for His rest.
 
 2  The types and figures of the Church
 2  In the Old Testament are these:
 2  A building meet for life and rule,
 2  A bride the man to match and please.
 
 3  God's people in the ancient times
 3  Were called by God His very spouse;
 3  Among them and with them were built
 3  God's ruling city and God's house.
 
 4  Incarnate God, the God-man, Christ,
 4  As Bridegroom for the Bride has come;
 4  With His own life He quickened her,
 4  That she His counterpart become.
 
 5  In resurrection Christ doth now,
 5  As David's Son, God's temple build,
 5  That God may have a resting place
 5  And there accomplish all He willed.
 
 6  The Church is thus the Bride of Christ,
 6  In whom His full delight doth rest;
 6  It is a dwelling place to God
 6  Where He may live and be expressed.
 
 7  The new Jerusalem will be
 7  The full perfection ultimate
 7  Of all the types of house and bride,
 7  Th' eternal plan to consummate.
 
 8  It is the Bride which matches Christ,
 8  Thru whom He may Himself express;
 8  It is God's tabernacle too
 8  In which our God can rule and rest.
 
 9  The ultimate completion 'tis
 9  Of God's work in humanity,
 9  His full expression glorious
 9  Thru His redeemed eternally.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  In His Christ to head up all things
 1     Is our God's economy;
 1  Taking Christ as Head and Center,
 1     All is one in harmony.
 
 2  Christ as Head will be the Center;
 2     God within will be the Light;
 2  Christ enthroned, with God, His substance,
 2     Will fulfill His heart's delight.
 
 3  Christ as life will be the content,
 3     Heading up all things in light;
 3  All the saints will be the vessel,
 3     To express His glory bright.
 
 4  Satan hath himself injected
 4     Into man all things to spoil,
 4  Bringing darkness and corruption
 4     God's eternal plan to foil.
 
 5  Christ has come, Himself imparting
 5     Into man as life to save,
 5  That the pow'r of death and darkness
 5     May no more all things enslave.
 
 6  Thru the Church which is His Body
 6     Christ as Head will sum up all;
 6  All will fitly join together,
 6     All things either great or small.
 
 7  Under Christ, by His full headship,
 7     All in union will subsist;
 7  In the light the Church expresses
 7     All in oneness will exist.
 
 8  Owning Christ as Head and Center,
 8     All will be in harmony;
 8  Thru the shining of His Body
 8     All will share His liberty.
 
 9  No more darkness and corruption,
 9     No more death and vanity;
 9  All will be released from bondage
 9     Throughout all eternity.

 1  How true it is no heart may comprehend
 1  The glory God prepareth for His own,
 1  And what will happen when this age shall end;
 1  But yet in vision Jesus hath made known
 1  How fair and holy shall the Church descend,
 1  Lit up with light of precious jasper stone.
 
 2  And He shall make His Church all heavenly fair,
 2  With gold and pearls, and every radiant stone,
 2  And reign in holiness and glory there,
 2  And shine as suns and stars have never shone;
 2  And He shall lead His Bride, His joy and care,
 2  With blissful singing to His Father's throne.
 
 3  And then the blest communion shall have come,
 3  Of God's dear children meeting from afar;
 3  Within His burning love they blend as one,
 3  Yet each, according as His counsels are,
 3  Shall have peculiar glory of his own,
 3  As one star differeth from another star.
 
 4  And God is all in all in that great day,
 4  And He is their exceeding great Reward;
 4  Their stream of life, their beautiful array,
 4  Their food, their joy, their radiance, Christ the Lord;
 4  The music of their wondrous song shall say,
 4  How great the joy that passeth thought or word.
 
 5  And this is that eternal life of heaven,
 5  Laid up with Christ in God, the mystery
 5  Of resurrection life which He hath given:
 5  A fount of living waters full and free;
 5  A life by which the gates of death are riven,
 5  A life which on the throne of Christ shall be.
 
 6  And here in this waste wilderness begun,
 6  So soon as we believe in Christ aright,
 6  And quickened by the Spirit of the Son,
 6  Receive Him as our only life and light,
 6  As all the branches in the vine are one,
 6  So we are one forever in His sight.
 
 7  Now come, Lord Jesus, quickly from above,
 7  Do Thou sustain us on the desert road,
 7  And draw us after Thee by might of love,
 7  Our Fatherland art Thou, O love of God;
 7  Once safe in Thee, no more shall we remove,
 7  O Thou our everlasting sure abode.

 1  There is a stream which issues forth
 1     From God's eternal throne
 1  And from the Lamb, a living stream,
 1     Clear as the crystal stone.
 1  In it doth grow the tree of life,
 1     It makes the ransomed sing:
 1  Its living draught revives the heart;
 1     Hence all the joys do spring.
 
 2  Such joys as are unspeakable,
 2     And full of glory too;
 2  Such splendid riches, meat and drink,
 2     As worldlings do not know.
 2  Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
 2     For fancy 'tis concealed,
 2  What Thou, Lord, hast laid up for Thine
 2     And hast to me revealed.
 
 3  I feel Thy touch, I hear Thy voice,

 3  My soul doth leap: but, oh, that I

 1  River of living water,
 1     River that flows from the throne,
 1  Fellowship giving and making
 1     God's own authority known.
 
River of living water,
Fellowship freely bestows;
Bringing authority with it,
Through every place where it flows.
 
 2  Water of life is the Spirit,
 2     God as the life in it flows;
 2  Carrying with it His Lordship,
 2     Through every place where it goes.
 
River of living water,
Fellowship freely bestows;
Bringing authority with it,
Through every place where it flows.
 
 3  Midst the gold street it floweth,
 3     Thus showing to us the way;
 3  As in God's nature it floweth,
 3     So in His way we will stay.
 
River of living water,
Fellowship freely bestows;
Bringing authority with it,
Through every place where it flows.
 
 4  The tree of life by the river,
 4     Shows to us God as our food;
 4  We by the river's full flowing
 4     Take of the tree's plenitude.
 
River of living water,
Fellowship freely bestows;
Bringing authority with it,
Through every place where it flows.

 1  No more in earthen vessels
 1     God's treasure then shall be,
 1  But in unclouded beauty
 1     Thou, Lord, wilt shine thru me.
 
 2  Afar thru that gold vessel
 2     God's glory shineth bright;
 2  There'll be no need of sunshine,
 2     For God will be the light.
 
 3  With Christ, the Stone most precious,
 3     God's city shall be fair;
 3  And He shall shine as jasper
 3     In cloudless glory there:
 
 4  Undimmed in that great vessel,
 4     The glory of that light,
 4  Illum'ning with its fulness
 4     The earth in radiance bright.
 
 5  All in His new creation
 5     God's glory there shall see;
 5  The vessel for that shining
 5     The Lamb's own Bride shall be:
 
 6  A golden vessel glorious,
 6     That all who see adore
 6  God in the Lamb in glory
 6     Expressed forevermore.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
 1     One day when sin was as black as could be,
 1  Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin -
 1     Dwelt among men, my example is He!
 
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming - O glorious day!
 
 2  One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,
 2     One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
 2  Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
 2     Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.
 
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming - O glorious day!
 
 3  One day they left Him alone in the garden,
 3     One day He rested, from suffering free;
 3  Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;
 3     Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.
 
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming - O glorious day!
 
 4  One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
 4     One day the stone rolled away from the door;
 4  Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
 4     Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.
 
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming - O glorious day!
 
 5  One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
 5     One day the skies with His glory will shine;
 5  Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
 5     Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!
 
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming - O glorious day!

O it was wonderful, blest be His name,

   Coming for me, for me;
O I shall see Him descend from the sky,

 1  O how sweet the glorious message,
 1     Simple faith my claim;
 1  Yesterday, today, forever,
 1     Jesus is the same.
 1  Still He loves to save the sinful,
 1     Heal the sick and lame;
 1  Cheer the mourner, still the tempest;
 1     Glory to His name!
 
Yesterday, today, forever,
   Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name.
 
 2  He who was the friend of sinners,
 2     Seeks thee, lost one, now;
 2  Sinner, come, and at His footstool,
 2     Penitently bow.
 2  He who said, "I'll not condemn thee,
 2     Go and sin no more,"
 2  Speaks to thee that word of pardon,
 2     As in days of yore.
 
Yesterday, today, forever,
   Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name.
 
 3  Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer,
 3     By His mighty hand;
 3  Still our sicknesses and sorrows,
 3     Go at His command.
 3  He who gave His healing virtue,
 3     To a woman's touch;
 3  To the faith that claims His fulness,
 3     Still will give as much.
 
Yesterday, today, forever,
   Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name.
 
 4  As of old He walked to Emmaus,
 4     With them to abide;
 4  So through all life's way He walketh,
 4     Ever near our side.
 4  Soon again we shall behold Him,
 4     Hasten, Lord, the day!
 4  But 'twill still be "this same Jesus,"
 4     As he went away.
 
Yesterday, today, forever,
   Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name,
   Glory to His name;
All may change, but Jesus never!
   Glory to His name.

 1  Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round!
 1  Oh, how deep the woe my Savior found
 1  When He walked across the waters of my soul,
 1  Bade my night disperse and made me whole!
 
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He went for me, He went for me;
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He died to set me free.
 
 2  Tremblingly a sinner bowed before His face,
 2  Naught I knew of pardon, God's free grace;
 2  Heard a voice so melting, "Cease thy wild regret,
 2  Jesus bought thy pardon, paid thy debt."
 
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He went for me, He went for me;
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He died to set me free.
 
 3  O 'twas wondrous love the Savior showed for me!
 3  When He left His throne for Calvary,
 3  When He bore my trespass, bore it all alone;
 3  Praise His name forever, make it known.
 
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He went for me, He went for me;
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
   He died to set me free.

Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,

 2  We may not know, we cannot tell,

 1  I hear the Savior say,
 1  "Thy strength indeed is small,
 1  Child of weakness, watch and pray,
 1  Find in Me thine all in all."
 
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.
 
 2  Lord, now indeed I find
 2  Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
 2  Can change the leper's spots,
 2  And melt the heart of stone.
 
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.
 
 3  For nothing good have I
 3  Whereby Thy grace to claim -
 3  I'll wash my garments white
 3  In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.
 
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.
 
 4  And when, before the throne,
 4  I stand in Him complete,
 4  "Jesus died my soul to save,"
 4  My lips shall still repeat.
 
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Christ has become one with sinners,
Sharing in all of our living;
Crucified even for sinners,
Glorious life to us giving.
 
Christ Jesus came for us,
Christ Jesus died for us;
O yes, for us, for us, for us.
Christ came and died for us.

 1  Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
 1     And did my Sovereign die?
 1  Would He devote that sacred head
 1     For such a worm as I?
 
At the cross, at the cross where
   I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
 
 2  Was it for sins that I had done
 2     He groaned upon the tree?
 2  Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
 2     And love beyond degree!
 
At the cross, at the cross where
   I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
 
 3  Well might the sun in darkness hide,
 3     And shut His glories in,
 3  When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
 3     For man, His creature's sin.
 
At the cross, at the cross where
   I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
 
 4  Thus might I hide my blushing face
 4     While His dear cross appears.
 4  Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
 4     And melt mine eyes to tears.
 
At the cross, at the cross where
   I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
 
 5  But drops of grief can ne'er repay
 5     The debt of love I owe;
 5  Here, Lord, I give myself away,
 5     'Tis all that I can do.
 
At the cross, at the cross where
   I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

 1  Working will not save me;
 1  Purest deeds that I can do,
 1  Holiest thoughts and feelings too,
 1  Cannot form my soul anew;
 1  Working will not save me.
 
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free,
He alone can save me.
 
 2  Weeping will not save me;
 2  Though my face were bathed in tears,
 2  That could not allay my fears,
 2  Could not wash the sins of years;
 2  Weeping will not save me.
 
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free,
He alone can save me.
 
 3  Waiting will not save me;
 3  Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,
 3  In my ear is mercy's cry;
 3  If I wait I can but die:
 3  Waiting will not save me.
 
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free,
He alone can save me.
 
 4  Praying will not save me;
 4  All the prayers that I could say
 4  Could not wash my sins away,
 4  All I owe could never pay:
 4  Praying will not save me.
 
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free,
He alone can save me.
 
 5  Faith in Christ will save me;
 5  Let me trust Thy gracious Son,
 5  Trust the work that He has done,
 5  To His arms, Lord, help me run;
 5  Faith in Christ will save me.
 
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free,
He alone can save me.

 1  Free from the law - oh, happy condition!
 1  Jesus hath bled, and there is remission;
 1  Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
 1  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
 
Once for all - oh, sinner, receive it;
Once for all - oh, doubter, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
 
 2  There on the cross your burden upbearing,
 2  Thorns on His brow your Savior is wearing;
 2  Never again your sin need appall,
 2  You have been pardoned once for all.
 
Once for all - oh, sinner, receive it;
Once for all - oh, doubter, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
 
 3  Now we are free - there's no condemnation;
 3  Jesus provides a perfect salvation:
 3  "Come unto Me," oh, hear His sweet call,
 3  Come, and He saves us once for all.
 
Once for all - oh, sinner, receive it;
Once for all - oh, doubter, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.
 
 4  Children of man - oh, glorious calling,
 4  Surely His grace will keep us from falling;
 4  Passing from death to life at His call,
 4  Blessed salvation once for all.
 
Once for all - oh, sinner, receive it;
Once for all - oh, doubter, believe it;
Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

"It is finished!" yes, indeed,

Sinner, this is all you need -

 2  When He, from His lofty throne,

 1  Why should I worry, doubt and fear?
 1  Has God not caused His Son to bear
 1     My sins upon the tree?
 1  The debt that Christ for me has paid,
 1  Would God another mind have made
 1     To claim again from me?
 
 2  Redemption full the Lord has made,
 2  And all my debts has fully paid,
 2     From law to set me free.
 2  I fear not for the wrath of God,
 2  For I've been sprinkled with His blood,
 2     It wholly covers me.
 
 3  For me forgiveness He has gained,
 3  And full acquittal was obtained,
 3     All debts of sin are paid;
 3  God would not have His claim on two,
 3  First on His Son, my Surety true,
 3     And then upon me laid.
 
 4  So now I have full peace and rest,
 4  My Savior Christ hath done the best
 4     And set me wholly free;
 4  By His all-efficacious blood
 4  I ne'er could be condemned by God,
 4     For He has died for me!

 1  There is a fountain filled with blood
 1     Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
 1  And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
 1     Lose all their guilty stains:
 1     Lose all their guilty stains,
 1     Lose all their guilty stains;
 1  And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
 1     Lose all their guilty stains.
 
 2  The dying thief rejoiced to see
 2     That fountain in his day;
 2  And there may I, though vile as he,
 2     Wash all my sins away:
 2     Wash all my sins away,
 2     Wash all my sins away;
 2  And there may I, though vile as he,
 2     Wash all my sins away.
 
 3  Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
 3     Shall never lose its power,
 3  Till all the ransomed ones of God
 3     Be saved, to sin no more:
 3     Be saved, to sin no more,
 3     Be saved, to sin no more;
 3  Till all the ransomed ones of God
 3     Be saved to sin no more.
 
 4  E'er since by faith I saw the stream
 4     Thy flowing wounds supply,
 4  Redeeming love has been my theme,
 4     And shall be till I die:
 4     And shall be till I die,
 4     And shall be till I die;
 4  Redeeming love has been my theme,
 4     And shall be till I die.
 
 5  When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
 5     Lies silent in the grave,
 5  Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
 5     I'll sing Thy power to save:
 5     I'll sing Thy power to save,
 5     I'll sing Thy power to save;
 5  Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
 5     I'll sing Thy power to save.

 1  O now I see the cleansing wave!
 1     The fountain deep and wide;
 1  Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,

The cleansing stream I see, I see;
I plunge, and O it cleanseth me!
O praise the Lord it cleanseth me!
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.
 
 2  I see the dear Redeemer raised,
 2     I hear the speaking blood;
 2  It speaks! My spirit is amazed!
 2     And quickened by its flood.
 
The cleansing stream I see, I see;
I plunge, and O it cleanseth me!
O praise the Lord it cleanseth me!
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.
 
 3  I rise to walk in God's own light

 1  One there is above all others,
 1        Oh, how He loves!
 1  His is love beyond a brother's,
 1        Oh, how He loves!
 1  Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
 1  One day soothe, the next day grieve us;
 1  But this Friend will ne'er deceive us:
 1        Oh, how He loves!
 
 2  'Tis eternal life to know Him,
 2        Oh, how He loves!
 2  Think, oh, think how much we owe Him,
 2        Oh, how He loves!
 2  With His precious blood He bought us,
 2  In the wilderness He sought us,
 2  To His flock He safely brought us:
 2        Oh, how He loves!
 
 3  Blessed Jesus! Would you know Him?
 3        Oh, how He loves!
 3  Give yourselves entirely to Him,
 3        Oh, how He loves!
 3  Think no longer of the morrow,
 3  From the past new courage borrow,
 3  Jesus carries all your sorrow:
 3        Oh, how He loves!
 
 4  All your sins shall be forgiven,
 4        Oh, how He loves!
 4  Backward shall your foes be driven,
 4        Oh, how He loves!
 4  Best of blessings He'll provide you,
 4  Nought but good shall e'er betide you,
 4  Safe to glory He will guide you:
 4        Oh, how He loves!

 1  There is no love like the love of Jesus,
 1     Never to fade or fall,
 1  Till into the rest of the house of God
 1     He has gathered us all.
 
Jesus' love, precious love,
   Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
   Jesus pleadeth for thee.
 
 2  There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
 2     Filled with a tender love;
 2  No throb nor throe that our hearts can know,
 2     But He feels it above.
 
Jesus' love, precious love,
   Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
   Jesus pleadeth for thee.
 
 3  There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,
 3     Piercing so far away;
 3  Ne'er out of the sight of its tender light
 3     Can the wanderer stray.
 
Jesus' love, precious love,
   Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
   Jesus pleadeth for thee.
 
 4  There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,
 4     Tender and sweet its chime;
 4  Like musical ring of a flowing spring
 4     In the bright summertime.
 
Jesus' love, precious love,
   Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
   Jesus pleadeth for thee.
 
 5  Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus!
 5     Then we shall never roam;
 5  And we shall rest on His loving breast,
 5     And with Him we'll be one!
 
Jesus' love, precious love,
   Boundless, and pure, and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
   Jesus pleadeth for thee.

If we do not believe in Him,

 1  Christ the Savior is just the One you need,

 1  In His body He suffered every pain
 1  And died to cleanse your every stain,
 1     So you need Jesus!
 
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
   Men and women all need Him!
For redemption you need Him,
For salvation you need Him!
And for everlasting life,
   Yes, you need Jesus!
 
 2  He has risen and gone up into heav'n,
 2  That life eternal might be fully giv'n;
 2  Just receive Him, believing in your heart,
 2  Then all you need He will impart,
 2     So you need Jesus!
 
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
   Men and women all need Him!
For redemption you need Him,
For salvation you need Him!
And for everlasting life,
   Yes, you need Jesus!
 
 3  He'll enlighten your darkened heart with light,
 3  Forgive your sins and rescue you with might;
 3  He will cleanse you from all stains with His blood,
 3  And give to you the life of God,
 3     So you need Jesus!
 
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
   Men and women all need Him!
For redemption you need Him,
For salvation you need Him!
And for everlasting life,
   Yes, you need Jesus!
 
 4  In your living there is a lack you sense,
 4  And thru the years it grows the more intense;
 4  Only Jesus this need can satisfy;
 4  All vanity He will defy,
 4     So you need Jesus!
 
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
   Men and women all need Him!
To escape from vanity,
To obtain reality,
To make life significant,
   Yes, you need Jesus!
 
 5  All this world now is rife with toil and pain,
 5  In troubled times there's nothing to sustain;
 5  All is empty, on what can you rely?
 5  All things reveal and testify,
 5     That you need Jesus!
 
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
   Men and women all need Him!
To escape from vanity,
To obtain reality,
To make life significant,
   Yes, you need Jesus!

 1  Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
 1     He is your heart's very need;
 1  What else can you desire or seek?
 1     All things are empty indeed!
 
He is so rich, He is so full,
   He can fulfill all your needs!
He is so good, He is so sweet,
   All your desire He exceeds!
 
 2  Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
 2     He is the One you require;
 2  Once you receive this glorious Christ,
 2     Never the rest you'll desire.
 
He is so rich, He is so full,
   He can fulfill all your needs!
He is so good, He is so sweet,
   All your desire He exceeds!
 
 3  Though very great is all the world,
 3     And very small is your heart,
 3  Yet the great world with all its wealth
 3     Never can fill your small heart.
 
He is so rich, He is so full,
   He can fulfill all your needs!
He is so good, He is so sweet,
   All your desire He exceeds!
 
 4  If you have Christ, you have all joys;
 4     Without this Christ, only pains;
 4  Where there is Christ there morning is;
 4     Where He is not, night remains.
 
He is so rich, He is so full,
   He can fulfill all your needs!
He is so good, He is so sweet,
   All your desire He exceeds!

 2     O hear Him now!
 2  Before your day is gone,
 2     To Jesus bow.
 
 3  Today the Savior calls;
 3     For refuge fly;
 3  The storm of vengeance falls,
 3     And death is nigh.
 
 4  The Spirit calls today;
 4     Yield to His pow'r;
 4  O grieve Him not away,
 4     'Tis mercy's hour!

 1  I hear my risen Savior say:
 1  "Follow me, follow me, follow me";
 1  His voice is calling all the day,
 1  "Follow me, follow me, follow me;
 1  For thee I trod the bitter way,
 1  For thee I gave my life away,
 1  And drank the gall thy debt to pay,
 1  Follow me, follow me, follow me."
 
 2  "I know thy life of guilt and pain;
 2  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 2  I know each ache of heart and brain;
 2  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 2  How often I have called in vain,
 2  And offered pardon in my name,
 2  And now I plead yet once again!
 2  Follow me, follow me, follow me!"
 
 3  "Though thou hast sinned I'll pardon thee;
 3  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 3  From every sin I'll set thee free;
 3  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 3  In all thy changing life I'll be
 3  Thy God, thy guide on land and sea,
 3  Thy bliss through all eternity,
 3  Follow me, follow me, follow me!"
 
 4  "Come, cast on Me thine every care;
 4  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 4  Thy heavy load I will upbear;
 4  Follow me, follow me, follow me!
 4  Come, look to Me - dismiss thy fears;
 4  And trust Me through eternal years;
 4  My hand shall wipe away thy tears;
 4  Follow me, follow me, follow me!"
 
 5  Dear Lord, I yield to Thee my will;
 5  I'll follow Thee, follow thee, follow thee!
 5  Oh, bid my struggling soul be still;
 5  I'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!
 5  Lord, cleanse me, with Thy Spirit fill,
 5  And keep me safe from every ill;
 5  And all Thy Word in me fulfill;
 5  I'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,
 1  Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
 1  Jesus ready waits to save you,
 1  Full of pity, love and pow'r:
 1  He is able, He is able,
 1  He is willing, doubt no more.
 
 2  Come, ye needy, come and welcome;
 2  God's free bounty glorify;
 2  True belief and true repentance,
 2  Every grace that brings us nigh,
 2  Without money, without money,
 2  Come to Jesus Christ and buy.
 
 3  Let not conscience make you linger,
 3  Nor of fitness fondly dream;
 3  All the fitness He requireth
 3  Is to feel your need of Him:
 3  This He gives you, this He gives you,
 3  'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.
 
 4  Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
 4  Lost and ruined by the fall;
 4  If you tarry till you're better,
 4  You will never come at all:
 4  Not the righteous, not the righteous,
 4  Sinners Jesus came to call.
 
 5  Agonizing in the garden,
 5  Your Redeemer prostrate lies;
 5  On the bloody tree behold Him!
 5  Hear Him cry, before He dies,
 5  "It is finished!" "It is finished!"
 5  Sinner, will not this suffice?
 
 6  Lo! th' incarnate God, ascended,
 6  Pleads the merit of His blood;
 6  Venture on Him, venture wholly;
 6  Let no other trust intrude:
 6  None but Jesus, none but Jesus,
 6  Can do helpless sinners good.

 1  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
 1     There is life at this moment for thee;
 1  Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
 1     Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.
 
Look! Look! Look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
 
 2  Oh, why was He there as the Bearer of sin,
 2     If on Jesus thy guilt was not laid?
 2  Oh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing blood,
 2     If His dying thy debt has not paid?
 
Look! Look! Look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
 
 3  It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,
 3     But the blood, that redeemeth the soul;
 3  On Him, then, who shed it, thou mayest at once
 3     Thy weight of iniquities roll.
 
Look! Look! Look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
 
 4  Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared
 4     There remaineth no more to be done;
 4  That once in the end of the world He appeared,
 4     And completed the work He begun.
 
Look! Look! Look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
 
 5  Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once
 5     The life everlasting He gives;
 5  And know with assurance, thou never canst die
 5     Since Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives.
 
Look! Look! Look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.

 1  He has been there oft before,
 1        Let Him in;
 1  Let Him in, ere He is gone,
 1  Let Him in, the Holy One,
 1  Jesus Christ, the Father's Son,
 1        Let Him in.
 
 2  Open now to Him your heart,
 2        Let Him in;
 2  If you wait He will depart,
 2        Let Him in;
 2  Let Him in, He is your Friend,
 2  He your soul will sure defend,
 2  He will keep you to the end,
 2        Let Him in.
 
 3  Hear you now His loving voice?
 3        Let Him in;
 3  Now, oh, now make Him your choice,
 3        Let Him in;
 3  He is standing at your door,
 3  Joy to you He will restore,
 3  And His name you will adore,
 3        Let Him in.
 
 4  Now admit the heav'nly Guest,
 4        Let Him in;
 4  He will make for you a feast,
 4        Let Him in;
 4  He will speak your sins forgiv'n.
 4  And when earth ties all are riv'n,
 4  Comfort, rest, you will be giv'n,
 4        Let Him in.

 1  Hark, the Savior's knocking, knocking,
 1     Knocking at your heart!
 1  Oh, do not be hardened, hardened,
 1     Lest He should depart.
 1  Rise and open up your heart,
 1     Quickly let Him in;
 1  Life divine He'll give you, give you,
 1     And forgive your sin.
 
Let Him in! Let Him in!
He's knocking at your heart;
Let Him in! Oh, let Him in!
Let Him in your heart.
 
 2  Why should you still tarry, tarry,
 2     Keep Him waiting there?
 2  He is kind and gracious, gracious,
 2     Merciful and dear.
 2  Listen to His tender voice,
 2     Do not grieve His heart;
 2  Won't you let Him enter, enter,
 2     And His grace impart.
 
Let Him in! Let Him in!
He's knocking at your heart;
Let Him in! Oh, let Him in!
Let Him in your heart.

 1  Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall -
 1  Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all:
 1  Hearken! What meaneth the sudden call?
 1     What will you do with Jesus?
 
What will you do with Jesus?
   Neutral you cannot be;
Some day your heart will be asking,
   "What will He do with me?"
 
 2  Jesus is standing on trial still,
 2  You can be false to Him if you will,
 2  You can be faithful through good or ill:
 2     What will you do with Jesus?
 
What will you do with Jesus?
   Neutral you cannot be;
Some day your heart will be asking,
   "What will He do with me?"
 
 3  Will you evade Him as Pilate tried?
 3  Or will you choose Him, whate'er betide?
 3  Vainly you struggle from Him to hide:
 3     What will you do with Jesus?
 
What will you do with Jesus?
   Neutral you cannot be;
Some day your heart will be asking,
   "What will He do with me?"
 
 4  Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny?
 4  Or will you scorn from His foes to fly,
 4  Daring for Jesus to live or die?
 4     What will you do with Jesus?
 
What will you do with Jesus?
   Neutral you cannot be;
Some day your heart will be asking,
   "What will He do with me?"
 
 5  "Jesus, I give Thee my heart today!
 5  Jesus, I'll follow Thee all the way,
 5  Gladly obeying Thee!" will you say:
 5     "This will I do with Jesus!"
 
What will you do with Jesus?
   Neutral you cannot be;
Some day your heart will be asking,
   "What will He do with me?"

 1  Life at best is very brief,
 1  Like the falling of a leaf,
 1  Like the binding of a sheaf,
 1        Be in time!
 1  Fleeting days are telling fast
 1  That the die will soon be cast,
 1  And the fatal line be passed,
 1        Be in time!
 
Be in time! Be in time!
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
   Be in time!
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
   Be in time!
 
 2  Fairest flowers soon decay,
 2  Youth and beauty pass away;
 2  O you have not long to stay,
 2        Be in time!
 2  While God's Spirit bids you come,
 2  Sinner, do not longer roam,
 2  Lest you seal your hopeless doom,
 2        Be in time!
 
Be in time! Be in time!
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
   Be in time!
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
   Be in time!
 
 3  Time is gliding swiftly by,
 3  Death and judgment draweth nigh,
 3  To the arms of Jesus fly,
 3        Be in time!
 3  O I pray you count the cost!
 3  Ere the fatal line be crossed,
 3  And your soul in hell be lost,
 3        Be in time!
 
Be in time! Be in time!
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
   Be in time!
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
   Be in time!
 
 4  Sinner, heed the warning voice,
 4  Make the Lord your final choice,
 4  Then all heaven will rejoice,
 4        Be in time!
 4  Come from darkness into light;
 4  Come, let Jesus make you right;
 4  Come, receive His life tonight,
 4        Be in time!
 
Be in time! Be in time!
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
   Be in time!
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
   Be in time!

 1  Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blest,
 1  With healing gifts for souls distrest,
 1  To find in Thee my Life, my Rest,
 1     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 2  Stained with the sins which I have wrought

 2  For pardon which Thy Blood hath bought,
 2     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 3  Weary of selfishness and pride,
 3  False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
 3  Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
 3     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 4  Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
 4  Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
 4  Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,
 4     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 5  I would not, if I could, conceal
 5  The ills which only Thou canst heal;
 5  So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,
 5     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 6  Wash me, and take away each stain,
 6  Let nothing of my sin remain;
 6  For cleansing, though it be through pain,
 6     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 7  To share with Thee Thy life divine,
 7  Thy very likeness to be mine,
 7  Since Thou hast made my nature Thine,
 7     Christ crucified, I come.
 
 8  To be what Thou wouldst have me be,
 8  Accepted, sanctified in Thee,
 8  Through what Thy grace shall work in me,
 8     Christ crucified, I come.

 1  I've wandered far away from God,
 1     Now I'm coming home;
 1  The paths of sin too long I've trod,
 1     Lord, I'm coming home.
 
Coming home, coming home,
   Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
   Lord, I'm coming home.
 
 2  I've wasted many precious years,

 2  I now repent with bitter tears,

Coming home, coming home,
   Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
   Lord, I'm coming home.
 
 3  I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,
 3     Now I'm coming home;
 3  I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;

Coming home, coming home,
   Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
   Lord, I'm coming home.
 
 4  My soul is sick, my heart is sore,

Coming home, coming home,
   Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
   Lord, I'm coming home.
 
 5  My only hope, my only plea,
 5     Now I'm coming home;
 5  That Jesus died, and died for me;
 5     Lord, I'm coming home.
 
Coming home, coming home,

 1  With broken heart and contrite sigh,
 1  A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
 1  Thy pard'ning grace is rich and free:
 1     O God, be merciful to me!
 
 2  I smite upon my troubled breast,
 2  With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
 2  Christ and His cross my only plea:
 2     O God, be merciful to me!
 
 3  Far off I stand with tearful eyes,
 3  Nor dare uplift them to the skies;
 3  But Thou dost all my anguish see,
 3     O God, be merciful to me!
 
 4  With alms, or deeds that I have done,
 4  Not one sin's pardon can be won;
 4  To Calvary alone I flee;
 4     O God, be merciful to me!
 
 5  And when redeemed from sin and hell,
 5  With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
 5  My raptured song shall ever be,
 5     God has been merciful to me!

 1  Jesus, lover of my soul,
 1  Let me to Thy bosom fly,
 1  While the nearer waters roll,
 1  While the tempest still is high:
 1  Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
 1  Till the storm of life is past;
 1  Safe into the haven guide;
 1  O receive my soul at last.
 
 2  Other refuge have I none,
 2  Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
 2  Leave, oh, leave me not alone,
 2  Still support and comfort me.
 2  All my trust on Thee is stayed,
 2  All my help from Thee I bring;
 2  Cover my defenseless head
 2  With the shadow of Thy wing.
 
 3  Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
 3  More than all in Thee I find;
 3  Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
 3  Heal the sick and lead the blind.
 3  Just and holy is Thy name,
 3  I am all unrighteousness;
 3  Vile and full of sin I am,
 3  Thou art full of truth and grace.
 
 4  Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
 4  Grace to cover all my sin;
 4  Let the healing streams abound;
 4  Make and keep me pure within.
 4  Thou of life the fountain art,
 4  Freely let me take of Thee;
 4  Spring Thou up within my heart,
 4  Rise to all eternity.

 1  Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

 1  Let the water and the blood,
 1  From Thy riven side which flowed,
 1  Be of sin the double cure,
 1  Save me from its guilt and power.
 
 2  Not the labor of my hands
 2  Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
 2  Could my zeal no respite know,
 2  Could my tears forever flow,
 2  All could never sin erase,
 2  Thou must save, and save by grace.
 
 3  Nothing in my hands I bring,
 3  Simply to Thy cross I cling;
 3  Naked, come to Thee for dress,
 3  Helpless, look to Thee for grace:
 3  Foul, I to the fountain fly,
 3  Wash me, Savior, or I die.
 
 4  While I draw this fleeting breath,
 4  When mine eyes shall close in death,
 4  When I soar to worlds unknown,
 4  See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
 4  Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
 4  Let me hide myself in Thee.

 1  Jesus, keep me near the cross,

In the cross, in the cross,

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
 1     When Thou camest to earth for me;
 1  But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
 1     For Thy holy nativity:
 
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee;
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
There is room in my heart for Thee.
 
 2  Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
 2     Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
 2  But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,
 2     And in great humility:
 
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee;
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
There is room in my heart for Thee.
 
 3  The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest
 3     In the shade of the forest tree;
 3  But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
 3     In the deserts of Galilee:
 
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee;
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
There is room in my heart for Thee.
 
 4  Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word
 4     That should set Thy people free;
 4  But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
 4     They bore Thee to Calvary:
 
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
Thy cross is my only plea;
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
Thy cross is my only plea.
 
 5  When heaven's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing
 5     At Thy coming to victory,
 5  Let Thy voice call me up, saying, "Yet there is room,
 5     There is room at My side for thee!"
 
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!
When Thou comest and callest for me;
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!
When Thou comest and callest for me.

 4        Glory to His name.
 
      Glory to His name,
      Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
      Glory to His name!

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
 1     That a soul so unworthy might live,
 1  And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
 1     All the sins of my life to forgive.
 
They were borne on the cross,
They were borne on the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,
Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.
 
 2  He is tender and loving and patient with me,
 2     While He cleanses my heart of its dross;
 2  But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free,
 2     For my sins were all borne on the cross.
 
They were borne on the cross,
They were borne on the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,
Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.
 
 3  I will cling to my Savior and never depart -
 3     I will joyfully journey each day,
 3  With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
 3     That my sins have been taken away.
 
They were borne on the cross,
They were borne on the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,
Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.

 1  In tenderness He sought me,
 1     Weary and sick with sin,
 1  And on His shoulders brought me
 1     Into His flock again.
 1  While angels in His presence sang
 1  Until the courts of heaven rang.
 
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
   Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!
 
 2  He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,
 2     And poured in oil and wine;
 2  He whispered to assure me,
 2     "I've found thee, thou art Mine:"
 2  I never heard a sweeter voice,
 2  It made my aching heart rejoice.
 
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
   Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!
 
 3  He pointed to the nail-prints,
 3     For me His blood was shed;
 3  A mocking crown so thorny,
 3     Was placed upon His head:
 3  I wondered what He saw in me,
 3  To suffer such a deep agony.
 
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
   Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!
 
 4  I'm sitting in His presence,
 4     The sunshine of His face,
 4  While with adoring wonder
 4     His blessings I retrace.
 4  It seems as if eternal days
 4  Are far too short to sound His praise.
 
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
   Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!
 
 5  So while the hours are passing,
 5     All now is perfect rest;
 5  I'm waiting for the morning,
 5     The brightest and the best,
 5  When He will call us to His side,
 5  To be with Him, His spotless Bride.
 
   Oh, the love that sought me!
   Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
   Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

 1  I was sinking deep in sin,
 1     Far from the peaceful shore,
 1  Very deeply stained within,
 1     Sinking to rise no more;
 1  But the Master of the sea
 1     Heard my despairing cry,
 1  From the waters lifted me,
 1     Now safe am I.
 
   Love lifted me!
   Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
   Love lifted me.
 
 2  All my heart to Him I give,
 2     Ever to Him I'll cling,
 2  In His blessed presence live,
 2     Ever His praises sing.
 2  Love so mighty and so true
 2     Merits my soul's best songs;
 2  Faithful, loving service, too,
 2     To Him belongs.
 
   Love lifted me!
   Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
   Love lifted me.
 
 3  Souls in danger, look above,
 3     Jesus completely saves;
 3  He will lift you by His love
 3     Out of the angry waves.
 3  He's the Master of the sea,
 3     Billows His will obey;
 3  He your Savior wants to be -
 3     Be saved today.
 
   Love lifted me!
   Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
   Love lifted me.

 1  Tell me the old, old story,
 1     Of unseen things above,
 1  Of Jesus and His glory,
 1     Of Jesus and His love;
 1  Tell me the story simply,
 1     As to a little child,
 1  For I am weak and weary,
 1     And helpless and defiled.
 
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
   Of Jesus and His love.
 
 2  Tell me the story slowly,
 2     That I may take it in -
 2  That wonderful redemption,
 2     God's remedy for sin;
 2  Tell me the story often,
 2     For I forget so soon,
 2  The "early dew" of morning
 2     Has passed away at noon.
 
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
   Of Jesus and His love.
 
 3  Tell me the story softly,
 3     With earnest tones and grave;
 3  Remember I'm the sinner
 3     Whom Jesus came to save;
 3  Tell me the story always,
 3     If you would really be,
 3  In any time of trouble,
 3     A comforter to me.
 
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
   Of Jesus and His love.
 
 4  Tell me the same old story,
 4     When you have cause to fear
 4  That this world's empty glory
 4     Is costing me too dear;
 4  And when the Lord's bright glory
 4     Is dawning on my soul,
 4  Tell me the old, old story:
 4     "Christ Jesus makes thee whole."
 
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
   Of Jesus and His love.

 1  O teach me what it meaneth:
 1     That Cross uplifted high,
 1  With One, the Man of Sorrows,
 1     Condemned to bleed and die.
 1  O teach me what it cost Thee
 1     To make a sinner whole;
 1  And teach me, Savior, teach me
 1     The value of a soul.
 
 2  O teach me what it meaneth:
 2     That sacred crimson tide,
 2  The blood and water flowing
 2     From Thine own wounded side.
 2  Teach me that if none other
 2     *Had sinned but only I,
 2  Yet still, O blessed Savior,
 2     Thou on the cross must die.
*Last three lines of verse 2, originally:
Had sinned, but I alone,
Yet still, Thy blood, O Jesus,
Thine only, must atone.
 
 3  O teach me what it meaneth:
 3     Thy love beyond compare,
 3  The love that reacheth deeper
 3     Than depths of self-despair!
 3  Yea, teach me, till there gloweth
 3     In this cold heart of mine
 3  Some feeble, pale reflection
 3     Of that pure love of Thine.
 
 4  O teach me what it meaneth,
 4     For I am full of sin;
 4  And grace alone can reach me,
 4     And love alone can win.
 4  O teach me, for I need Thee,
 4     I have no hope beside,
 4  The chief of all the sinners
 4     For whom the Savior died.
 
 5  O teach me what it meaneth:
 5     The rest which Thou dost give
 5  To all the heavy-laden
 5     Who look to Thee and live.
 5  Because I am a rebel
 5     Thy pardon I receive:
 5  Because Thou dost command me,
 5     I can, I do believe.
 
 6  O infinite Redeemer,
 6     I bring no other plea;
 6  Because Thou dost invite me
 6     I cast myself on Thee.
 6  Because Thou dost accept me
 6     I love and I adore;
 6  Because Thy love constraineth,
 6     I'll praise Thee evermore.

 1  There were ninety and nine that safely lay
 1     In the shelter of the flock,
 1  But one was on the hills away,
 1     Far off in the cold and dark;
 1  Away on the mountains wild and bare,
 1  Away from the tender Shepherd's care.
 
 2  "Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
 2     Are they not enough for Thee?"
 2  But the Shepherd made answer: "This of Mine
 2     Has wandered away from Me;
 2  And although the road be rough and steep,
 2  I go to the desert to find My sheep."
 
 3  But none of the ransomed ever knew
 3     How deep were the waters crossed;
 3  Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed though
 3     Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
 3  Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry -
 3  All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.
 
 4  "Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way
 4     That mark out the mountain's track?"
 4  "They were shed for one who had gone astray
 4     Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
 4  "Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"
 4  "They're pierced tonight by many a thorn."
 
 5  And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,
 5     And up from the rocky steep,
 5  There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,
 5     "Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
 5  And the angels echoed around the throne,
 5  "Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  One sat alone beside the highway begging,
 1     His eyes were blind, the light he could not see;
 1  He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows,
 1     Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee.
 
When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
   When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
   For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.
 
 2  From home and friends the evil spirits drove him,
 2     Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
 2  He cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him,
 2     Then Jesus came and set the captive free.
 
When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
   When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
   For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.
 
 3  "Unclean! Unclean!" the leper cried in torment,
 3     The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near;
 3  The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim,
 3     Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.
 
When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
   When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
   For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.
 
 4  Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,
 4     For death had come and taken him away;
 4  Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling,
 4     Then Jesus came and night was turned to day.
 
When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
   When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
   For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.
 
 5  So men today have found the Savior able,
 5     They could not conquer passion, lust and sin;
 5  Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,
 5     Then Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within.
 
When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
   When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
   For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

 1  If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
 1  Were my life worth living for a day?
 1  Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
 1  In the things that soon must pass away?
 1  If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
 1  Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
 1  Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
 1  For a moment with a Christ-filled life?
 
 2  Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
 2  And a name revered both far and near,
 2  Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,
 2  Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
 2  If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
 2  Who endured the cross and died for me,
 2  Could then all the world afford a refuge,
 2  Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?
 
 3  O what emptiness! - without the Savior
 3  'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
 3  And eternity, how dark without Him!
 3  Only night and tears and endless woe!
 3  What, though I might live without the Savior,
 3  When I come to die, how would it be?
 3  O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
 3  And without Him all eternity!
 
 4  O the joy of having all in Jesus!
 4  What a balm the broken heart to heal!
 4  Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
 4  Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
 4  If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
 4  Nothing else in all the world beside -
 4  O then everything is mine in Jesus;
 4  For my needs and more He will provide.

 3  We'll have our worries just the same!
 3     It's all vanity!
 
Vanity! Vanity!
Vanity! Vanity!
'Tis chasing the wind,
It's all vanity!
 
 4  Days of toil to gain and restless nights:
 4  Though gained without calamity,
 4  When death comes it is gone for aye!
 4     It's all vanity!
 
Vanity! Vanity!
Vanity! Vanity!
'Tis chasing the wind,
It's all vanity!
 
 5  Remember God in days of youth!
 5  Fear Him, and such will be your gain!
 5  With Him you will be satisfied,
 5     For He is not vain!
 
Christ without, all is vain!
Christ within, all is gain!
All things are vain,
Christ only is gain!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,
 1  The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.
 1  His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell
 1  The man who in God's tabernacle may dwell.
 
 2  "Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide" -
 2  In God He took refuge whate'er did betide.
 2  "O Thou art my Lord, I've no good beyond Thee" -
 2  He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.
 
 3  "As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,"
 3  To Him they're the people of excellent worth.
 3  Of them He has said He has all His delight -
 3  In proving this all the four Gospels unite.
 
 4  "The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup" -
 4  For everything He to the Father looked up.
 4  "The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give" -
 4  Himself He denied and by God's word did live.
 
 5  His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,
 5  And e'en in His death praise to God could be voiced;
 5  His soul God would never abandon to hell,
 5  But in resurrection His body would dwell.
 
 6  God raised Him, and He with God's glory was crowned;
 6  Then fulness of joy in God's presence He found.
 6  E'en now at the Father's right hand is His seat,
 6  Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.

 1  O how nigh the Lord is unto all who call on Him!
 1  When we call, His very presence strengthens us within.
 1  Seeking Jesus, He is found, and calling, He is near -

 4  I will call upon His name as long as I shall live,
 4  Because He has inclined His ear, and grace so full does give.
 
Jesus! O what a name!
O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
Name victorious, name all-glorious,
   Name exalted - O what a name!
Jesus! Strengthening name!
O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,

 5  We are those who call upon His name in every place
 5  With all the saints who from a pure heart call and taste His grace.
 
Jesus! O what a name!
O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
Name victorious, name all-glorious,
   Name exalted - O what a name!
Jesus! Strengthening name!
O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
   "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!

How we love the glorious name,
   The name of Jesus!
'Tis the name above all names -
   On earth or in heav'n.
As we breathe this precious name,
   Darkness and death cannot remain;
For we call and get the Person of that name!
 
Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues -
   We gladly confess Thy name,
To the glory of the Father God above.
   For to us to speak Thy praise,
Is the enjoyment of our days;
   Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!

 1  Oh, hallelujah, what a death
 1     Christ died upon the cross!
 1  Not only was He dying there
 1  But everything that death did share:
 1     God was included too,
 1     All men with me and you -
 1  Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!
 
 2  Oh, praise the Lord, man died in God
 2     And to an end was brought!
 2  Now from this man I'm wholly free
 2  For God has terminated me!
 2     Oh, what a wondrous death,
 2     Oh, what a wondrous death;
 2  Oh, hallelujah, for such a death!
 
 3  Oh, praise the Lord, God died in man,
 3     In man to be released.
 3  The grain of wheat fell to the ground,
 3  And now a multitude is found
 3     Filled with the life of God,
 3     Filled with the life of God;
 3  Oh, hallelujah, for such a life!
 
 4  Lord, how we praise You for Your cross,
 4     Your all-inclusive death!
 4  The center of the universe,
 4  It has untold, eternal worth!
 4     Lord, how we love Your cross,

 4  Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!

 1  God was born a human being
 1     As the Babe of Bethlehem,
 1  Passed He then through human living,
 1     Perfect blend of God with men.
 1  God, according to His plan,
 1     Lived a mingled life with man.
 1  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
 1     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 2  Then with God this man was blended
 2     On the altar as He died;
 2  God and man and all creation
 2     On the cross were crucified.
 2  Man and all of God's creation,
 2     Sunk in total termination.
 2  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
 2     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 3  Everything we are was ended,
 3     Terminated on the cross,
 3  Only man in God ascended,
 3     Man in Adam suffered loss.
 3  Hallelujah, we're elated,
 3     Our old man was terminated.
 3  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
 3     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 4  Like the grain of wheat that's buried
 4     In the earth to be increased,
 4  God's own life the death must suffer,
 4     Thus in man to be released.
 4  Oh, the Lord of all be praised;
 4     God released in man is raised!
 4  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
 4     Hallelujah, Amen!

 1  We praise Thee, O Lord Jesus, Thou didst come,

 1  We worship Thee that Thou didst leave Thy throne,
 1  To come as our High Priest with sin to deal.
 1  Lord Jesus, Thou hast offered Thine own blood,
 1  And settled once for all our peace with God.
 
 2  Thy blood has now been sprinkled on the throne
 2  In full redemption for Thy people's sin.
 2  The sweetness of the love that Thou hast shown
 2  Has ris'n to fill the holiest place within.
 2  And by the blood once offered in that place
 2  God flows to us in mercy and in grace.
 
 3  Yet, Lord, Thou camest not just to atone,
 3  But Thou didst come and bear our sins away.
 3  We, with a conscience purged, approach the throne,
 3  For all our sins were laid on Thee that day.
 3  Thou, separated from the Father's face,
 3  Didst pay the awful price for us in grace.
 
 4  The way into God's presence thus is cleared,
 4  For ransomed sinners who have heard Thy call.
 4  Thou, Lord, hast taken all that we had feared
 4  When Thou didst shed Thy blood and give Thine all;
 4  Our heart in grateful praise to Thee we bind,
 4  And now our life in Thee alone we find.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  The saints throughout the centuries
 1  Have praised the Lord that He,
 1  The Lamb of God, has saved us,
 1  From sin has set us free;
 1  Yet scarcely for the Lion
 1  Have we yet sounded praise,
 1  Though oft for our redemption
 1  We've all our voices raised.
 
 2  John wept as he considered
 2  That none the right did own
 2  The scroll to take and open,
 2  God's myst'ry to make known;
 2  No, none on earth nor heaven,
 2  Nor universe around -
 2  And we, too, would be weeping
 2  If none were worthy found.
 
 3  The universe, mysterious,
 3  Would be in darkness still,
 3  Could none break through to open
 3  The scroll, to show God's will;
 3  But, lo, the worthy Lion
 3  Of Judah hath prevailed
 3  The seven seals to open,
 3  And have the scroll unveiled.
 
 4  No longer now in darkness
 4  God's secret is enclosed,
 4  But to our inner vision
 4  It's open, full, disclosed;
 4  Our hearts are for this purpose,
 4  Our lives are for His plan;
 4  And for this revelation
 4  We praise the Lion-Lamb!
 
 5  The four-and-twenty elders
 5  All fall before that sight.
 5  The living creatures praise Him,
 5  Who rest not, day nor night.
 5  So let us join their praises
 5  To Him who loosed God's plan;
 5  We'll lift with theirs our voices
 5  To praise the Lion-Lamb!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 
 1  Through countless ages, many men
 1  Have longed and sought and tried to see
 1  The secret of the universe,
 1  So vast, so great a mystery.
 
 2  Yet not through struggling could frail man
 2  The secret of this myst'ry find;
 2  Nor change, by stumbling, come upon
 2  Such hidden things - to these he's blind.
 
 3  Behold in heav'n a throne is set,
 3  And One upon the throne revealed;
 3  And held in His right hand a scroll -
 3  The mystery is tightly sealed.
 
 4  Through all the universe, a cry -
 4  'Can one be found of such great worth
 4  The scroll to take? ... yet no reply,
 4  From heav'n, below, or on the earth.
 
 5  Were it a matter now for man
 5  By chance, or some ability,
 5  Then surely one would now step forth
 5  To open God's economy.
 
 6  Yet sad and solemn was that sight.
 6  John wept as then he looked around;
 6  And we, too, still might weeping be
 6  If none at all were worthy found.
 
 7  But then the angel said, 'Weep not!
 7  Behold, the Lion has prevailed
 7  To take the scroll and loose its seals;
 7  He has the mystery now unveiled!'
 
 8  So, John looked up the Lion to see,
 8  But, lo, he then beheld a Lamb;
 8  Christ both o'ercame the enemy,
 8  And wrought redemption's work for man.
 
 9  The angels fall before His throne,
 9  Four living creatures offer praise,

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  Lo, the nations all assemble
 1     And imagine vanity,
 1  Kings and princes plot together
 1     'Gainst the Lord in unity.
 1  "Let us break their bonds asunder,
 1     Cast away their cords from us."
 1  'Gainst the Lord and His Anointed
 1     Worldly rulers counsel thus.
 
 2  He who sitteth in the heavens
 2     In contempt will laugh at them,
 2  Vex them in His fierce displeasure,
 2     Terrifying all such men.
 2  Yet upon the hill of Zion
 2     God has His anointed King -
 2  This is God's own declaration,
 2     All the kings admonishing.
 
 3  Now 'tis Christ, 'tis God's Anointed,
 3     Who declares the Lord's decree:
 3  "Thou'rt my Son (in resurrection),
 3     This day I've begotten Thee.
 3  For Thine own inheritance.
 3     Thou shalt dash them into pieces
 3  In Thy kingly excellence."
 
 4  Now be wise, O be instructed,
 4     All ye rulers of the earth,
 4  Fear the Lord, rejoice with trembling,
 4     Serve the only One of worth.
 4  Kiss the Son, lest He be angry
 4     And ye perish in the way.
 4  "All who trust in Him are blessed,"
 4     All who trust in Him will say.
 
 5  Lord, we praise Thee, we have seen Him -
 5     Thy unique Anointed One -
 5  And from vanity repenting,
 5     We in love have kissed Thy Son.
 5  "All who trust in Him are blessed" -
 5     Not "all those who keep the law."
 5  In that risen One believing,
 5     We are blest forevermore.

 1  The Lord shall get the glory
 1  If we will sing His praise,
 1  And angel hosts will listen
 1  When we our voices raise;
 1  The world around will hear us
 1  Give glory unto God,
 1  And Satan's hosts will tremble
 1  And flee our conqu'ring rod.
 
 2  Our mouth shut up defeats us
 2  And wins the Devil's smile;
 2  So why not open battle
 2  And chase him all the while.
 2  By "sacrifice of praises"
 2  And shouts of victory -
 2  'Twill cost us but our faces
 2  God's chosen fools to be!
 
 3  The world has never helped us
 3  To shout our Savior's praise,
 3  Nor given Him the glory
 3  Nor lent one thankful phrase;
 3  So need we ask permission
 3  To praise th' ascended Lord?
 3  Cry out! Release your spirit!
 3  Much grace He does afford!
 
 4  O brothers, be not silent!
 4  O sisters, cry aloud!
 4  The sound shall tell God's triumph
 4  And blessings far abroad.
 4  Now is the time to praise Him,
 4  Yes now, at any cost!
 4  O joy in your salvation,
 4  And in His mercy boast!

 1  O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
 1     Thy name in all the earth!
 1  Let every people, tribe, and tongue
 1     Proclaim its boundless worth.
 1  Out of the mouth of little ones
 1     Thou hast established praise,
 1  That Thou may still Thine enemy
 1     And swiftly end his days.
 
 2  When we the universe behold,
 2     The work of Thy great hand -
 2  The sun, the moon, and all the stars
 2     By lofty wisdom planned;
 2  O what is man that Thou should'st care
 2     That Thou should'st mindful be?
 2  The son of man Thou visitest
 2     In Thine economy.
 
 3  O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man,
 3     The One who joined our race,
 3  Who put upon Himself the flesh
 3     And took a lower place.
 3  But now with glory Thou art crowned,
 3     With sovereignty complete.
 3  Now through Thy Body Thou dost rule
 3     With all beneath Thy feet.
 
 4  Thine incarnation, rising too,
 4     And Thy transcendency,
 4  Thy Lordship, Headship, kingdom full,
 4     And Body here we see.
 4  By all these steps of work divine
 4     Thou hast established praise.
 4  With overflowing hearts to Thee
 4     Our joyful voice we raise.
 
 5  Oh, soon that blessed day shall come -
 5     All tongues these words shall peal!
 5  But in the local churches now
 5     We have a foretaste real.
 5  O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
 5     Thy name in all the earth!
 5  Let every people, tribe, and tongue
 5     Proclaim its boundless worth.

 1  Our hearts are overflowing

 1  To tell what we've experienced
 1     Of our exalted King.
 1  Our tongues as pens are ready,
 1     We've volumes here to "write" -

 4  'Tis with the oil of gladness
 4     God has anointed Thee
 4  Above all Thy companions -
 4     How worthy there to be!
 
 5  Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia
 5     Do all Thy garments smell:
 5  Thy death and resurrection
 5     Do all Thy deeds forthtell.
 5  Out of the local churches
 5     Shall praises make Thee glad,
 5  And praises upon praises
 5     Thy joyful saints shall add.

 1  The queen in gold of Ophir
 1     At Thy right hand doth stand;
 1  King's daughters are the women
 1     Who fill Thy honored band.
 1  The church in all her glory
 1     Shall match her glorious King,
 1  And all the saints, the women,
 1     Thy likeness there shall bring.
 
 2  O daughter, now consider,
 2     E'en now incline thine ear:
 2  Remember not thy people
 2     And all thine own things here.
 2  Thy beauty then shall blossom -
 2     'Twill be the King's desire;
 2  For He thy worthy Lord is,
 2     Thy worship to inspire.
 
 3  The daughter's glorious garments
 3     Are made of inwrought gold -
 3  Within the inner palace,
 3     How wondrous to behold!
 3  The glory of God's nature
 3     Is given her to wear,
 3  That all His holy being
 3     She may in life declare.
 
 4  In clothing too embroidered
 4     She'll to the King be led,
 4  In that fine linen garment
 4     To be exhibited.
 4  'Tis by the Spirit's stitching
 4     That Christ in us is wrought,
 4  And with this glorious garment
 4     We'll to the King be brought.
 
 5  What gladness and rejoicing
 5     When we the King shall see!
 5  We'll shout His worthy praises
 5     Through all eternity.
 5  And though the King we worship
 5     Or glory in the Queen,
 5  In all this blest enjoyment
 5     The glory goes to Him.

 1  God shall rise, His foes be scattered,
 1     All that hate Him flee away.
 1  As the wax before the fire,
 1     All the wicked He shall slay.
 1  But the righteous shall rejoice
 1     With a loud, triumphant voice,
 1  Singing praises, singing praises,
 1     Singing praises unto God!
 
 2  He is riding through the deserts,
 2     Bringing in His saints in need.
 2  He's a Father to the orphans
 2     And a refuge tried indeed
 2  In His holy habitation -
 2     What a wonderful salvation!
 2  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 2     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 3  Here the lone have found a family,
 3     Here the desolate a home;
 3  Prisoners are brought from bondage
 3     To prosperity unknown.
 3  For the flock - what wondrous grace -
 3     God prepared this dwelling place:
 3  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 3     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 4  Now the Lord in mighty triumph
 4     Sends the news of victory;
 4  We the "women" spread the tidings -
 4     "Kings of armies flee, they flee!"
 4  No more sweat and dreary toil;
 4     We at home divide the spoil!
 4  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 4     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 5  Lo, on high Christ hath ascended,
 5     Leading captives in His train;
 5  These as gifts He has perfected
 5     That the Lord may dwell with them.
 5  Brothers, sisters, we are those,
 5     We're those transformed, vanquished foes!
 5  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 5     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 6  Blessed be the Lord forever:
 6     Day by day He loads with good,
 6  E'en the God of our salvation -
 6     Spread His worthy praise abroad.
 6  His the goings forth from death,
 6     Every foe He conquereth!
 6  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 6     Hallelujah, Amen!
 
 7  They have seen, O God, Thy goings
 7     In Thy holy dwelling place,
 7  Thy triumphal, high processions
 7     Midst a mighty voice of praise.
 7  See the singers go before,
 7     Praising, praising o'er and o'er:
 7  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 7     Hallelujah! Amen!
 
 8  Little Benjamin is leading,
 8     Then great Judah's company:
 8  Son of sorrow at God's right hand,
 8     Lion with the scepter see.
 8  Zebulun and Naphtali
 8     Make the joyful tidings fly:
 8  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 8     Hallelujah! Amen!
 
 9  Saints, thy strength has been commanded
 9     From the temple glorious;
 9  Still we pray that God may strengthen
 9     All that He has wrought for us.
 9  Higher yet our praises shall rise
 9     Till the utmost earth replies:
 9  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
 9     Hallelujah! Amen!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  The Lord said unto my Lord,
 1  "Sit Thou at My right hand;
 1  Thy foes shall be Thy footstool,
 1  Upon them Thou shalt stand."
 1  The sceptre of Thy strength shall
 1  The Lord from Zion send
 1  To rule o'er all the nations
 1  Forever 'til the end.
 
 2  A voluntary offering,
 2  The young ones are to Thee;
 2  In consecration's splendor
 2  How beautiful to see!
 2  For as the dew of morning
 2  Refreshes all the land -
 2  The young ones given to Thee
 2  Are precious in Thy hand.
 
 3  The Lord hath sworn forever
 3  And never will turn back,
 3  "Thou art a priest forever,
 3  As was Melchizedek."
 3  Oh, Thou hast no beginning
 3  Of days; of life: no end!
 3  And on Thine intercession
 3  We ever do depend.
 
 4  The Lord is at Thy right hand
 4  And in His day of wrath
 4  He'll strike through rulers, judging
 4  The nations in His path.
 4  While riding on to triumph
 4  He'll drink of us, the stream,
 4  His head uplifted, strengthened,
 4  The whole earth to redeem.
 
 5  Oh Lord, Thou art ascended
 5  To God's right hand to sit;
 5  As Head o'er all things, to Thee
 5  God doth Thy foes commit.
 5  Our King - for us Thou reignest,
 5  Our Priest - we are supplied,
 5  Our all we give unto Thee,
 5  Thou Conqueror glorified.

 2  He's the river! Wonderful!
 
 3  What He is: He's the vine tree.

 7  He is wonderful, wonderful.
 7  He is wonderful, wonderful.

 1  Lord, Thou art our peace offering;
 1     We lay our hands on Thee.
 1  We're one with Thee, Lord Jesus,
 1     In fact and practically.
 1  Here in the tent of meeting
 1     We offer Thee to God
 1  And with the Father feasting
 1     Enjoy Thee as our food.
 
Christ is our peace! Christ is our peace!
   We praise Thee, blessed Lord!
Our peace with God, our peace with man
   Have fully been restored.
 
 2  O what a peace it gives us
 2     To see the sprinkled blood.
 2  The blood of our peace offering
 2     Has brought us peace with God.
 2  With boldness we're proclaiming -
 2     Now hear this, enemy -
 2  "Peace by the blood of Jesus!"
 2     This is our victory.
 
Christ is our peace! Christ is our peace!
   We praise Thee, blessed Lord!
Our peace with God, our peace with man
   Have fully been restored.
 
 3  Based on the burnt oblation
 3     And the meal offering too,
 3  We now may offer Jesus
 3     As our peace offering true.
 3  The more we eat and drink Him
 3     In His humanity,
 3  The more we may enjoy Him
 3     While feasting corporately.
 
What fellowship, what fellowship
   With God and man we share!
O what a joy, O what a feast
   With all God's people here.
 
 4  Here God enjoys His portion -
 4     'Tis inward, hidden, sweet -
 4  And all the priestly family
 4     May here the wave breast eat.
 4  The offering priest - how precious -
 4     May of the best partake:
 4  He gets the right heave shoulder
 4     And one unleavened cake.
 
What fellowship, what fellowship
   With God and man we share!
O what a joy, O what a feast
   With all God's people here.
 
 5  How sweet to eat the wave breast,
 5     The all-embracing love
 5  Of Christ in resurrection!
 5     It sets us all above.
 5  What strength to eat the shoulder
 5     Of the ascended One
 5  And with the cake be nourished
 5     To walk as He has done.
 
What fellowship, what fellowship
   With God and man we share!
O what a joy, O what a feast
   With all God's people here.
 
 6  With all the cleansed ones feasting,
 6     How rich the Christ we eat!
 6  Oh, this is true communion,
 6     The only way to meet.
 6  We bring our full thanksgiving
 6     And e'en would make a vow -
 6  We're for the Lord's recovery
 6     As He is for us now.
 
What fellowship, what fellowship
   With God and man we share!
O what a joy, O what a feast
   With all God's people here.

 1  We gather together to eat the Lord's supper:
 1  By eating and drinking, our oneness we show.
 1  His presence possessing, our oneness confessing,
 1  'Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.
 
 2  We're eating the bread of His body once broken
 2  As now we're enjoying His Body made one:
 2  One loaf on the table - one Body, we're able
 2  To testify to all that the Lord's made us one.
 
 3  We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,
 3  The church's true fellowship of the Lord's blood;
 3  Redeemed by believing, all saints we're receiving,
 3  All those who through redemption have come unto God.
 
 4  Oh, what can we say now except "Hallelujah!"
 4  For such a reality given to us.
 4  Thy blood we're employing, Thy Body enjoying;
 4  Thus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious.

 1  We're gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:
 1  Though we be many, yet we all are one.
 1  We share Thy life and own that we are members,
 1  And thus within, in life we all are one.
 
There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
For all to see, for all to see.
 
 2  There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:
 2  'Twas broken so that all the saints may share.
 2  We eat this bread and, as we are partaking,
 2  Our actual oneness with all saints declare.
 
There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
For all to see, for all to see.
 
 3  One bread, one cup are now upon the table,
 3  Showing that we can be naught else but one.
 3  Christ has redeemed us, made us His own Body:
 3  What can we say but, "Amen, Lord, we're one!"
 
There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
For all to see, for all to see.
 
 4  We stand as one, and cannot be divided,
 4  Because our oneness is of Christ alone.
 4  We eat as one: one loaf, one cup partaking,
 4  And thus our oneness visibly is shown.
 
There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
For all to see, for all to see.
 
 5  Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!
 5  We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;
 5  And we too share this blissful satisfaction -
 5  Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.
 
There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
For all to see, for all to see.

 1  Take, drink this cup, His blood,
 1  Redemption of our God.
 1  The peace which Christ has made,
 1  Is in this cup displayed.
 1  We fellowship now with the Son:
 1  On Calvary the work was done:
 1  The way is clear, now all can come!
 
 2  Take, drink this cup, each one,
 2  His death show till He come.
 2  Eat, drink, display this feast:
 2  God in the Lamb released!
 2  Around the table, sup and dine;
 2  We eat the bread and drink the wine.
 2  All blessing in this cup we find.
 
 3  No blood of cow or goat
 3  Could give us any hope.
 3  Our sins would all remain
 3  Still year by year the same.
 3  A God-man, sinless, He must find -
 3  No other offering of His kind,
 3  A spotless lamb for all mankind.
 
 4  Come! Now enjoy His blood.
 4  What access this to God!
 4  Here wondrous cleansing power
 4  Flows to us, hour by hour.
 4  One sacrifice for all was made,
 4  And peace our conscience does pervade.
 4  Redemption's price is fully paid!
 
 5  Redeemer! Savior! King!
 5  Of Thy dear blood we sing,
 5  For in it now we see
 5  Thy mercy, boundless, free.
 5  This cup, our portion blessed of God,
 5  Is of the cov'nant in Thy blood -
 5  Dear, precious, precious, priceless blood!

 1  O Jesus Lord, when present at Thy table,
 1  And on the bread and on the wine we gaze;
 1  We praise Thee, Lord, that Thou as food art able
 1  To be enjoyed by man in many ways.
 
So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
 
 2  O what a shame - when Christ with all His riches,
 2  Has come into the world, life to supply -
 2  That man would live, not by Him, but by teachings,
 2  So powerless these riches to apply.
 
But all we need to do is eat the Lord;
He's marvelous, He's wonderful!
And as we eat, we're inwardly restored;
Christ grows in us, grows to the full.
 
 3  O Jesus Christ, Thou camest not to mankind
 3  To be a king, to rule us outwardly.
 3  But Thou hast come as food to satisfy us,
 3  And by Thy life to guide us inwardly.
 
So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
 
 4  We praise Thee, Lord, for all Thy glorious grandeur,
 4  For all Thy strength and majesty replete;
 4  And yet, O Lord, what special thanks we give Thee,
 4  That all Thou art is small enough to eat.
 
So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

 1  Gathered at Thy table, Lord;

 4  To our great Melchisedec,
 4  Render we our highest praise!

 1  The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
 1  Our spirits rejoice in this living inflow.
 1  For just as our body the breath does receive,
 1  So also in spirit to live it is so.
 
 2  The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
 2  What thing more important than breathing to do?
 2  For breathing each moment, new life we receive,
 2  And God's living freshness is constant and new.
 
 3  For God has been processed, as air now, He's free;
 3  This life-giving pneuma is all that we need.
 3  He's rich and abundant, so plentiful, He,
 3  In spirit to walk is to breathe Him indeed.
 
 4  O, say, aren't you glad that the Spirit's outpoured
 4  And God, fully processed, is flowing in us?

 1  We have come, we have come to the house of God;
 1  We have come to the house, whence outflows the flood.
 1  On the right, day and night, constant is its flow,
 1  Watering us and causing fruits of life to grow.
 
 2  From the house, from the house flows this living stream,
 2  From the house, to the earth, with the life supreme.
 2  Yet more deep, Lord, we seek that the flow may be;
 2  Thus we must be measured and possessed by Thee.
 
 3  Measure us, measure us, measure every day;
 3  Measure us, measure more, measure all the way,
 3  Till we know that the flow is a mighty flood,
 3  Sweeping over all the earth for Christ the Lord.
 
 4  Take us through, take us through, take us through the flow;
 4  Take us through, through and through, everywhere we go.
 4  Flow increase, never cease, till we swim in Thee,
 4  Till we are immersed in God eternally.
 
 5  All shall live, all shall live where the river comes;
 5  All shall live, really live, everywhere it runs.
 5  Let the fount from this mount life abundant bring,
 5  Till the deserts of the earth with churches spring!

 1  Pure myrrh and cinnamon,
 1  Calamus and cassia -
 1  These are Thy elements,
 1     Jesus my Lord!
 1  In olive oil they're blent
 1  In wondrous measurement -
 1  O what an ointment this,
 1     Anointing us!
 
Four-in-one mingled,
Compounded Spirit,
Sweet with Christ's suffering death,
Full of fragrance
Of resurrection -
O what an ointment flows
   In spirit, Lord!
 
 2  Stacte and onycha,
 2  Galbanum and frankincense -
 2  There are Thy elements,
 2     Jesus my Lord!
 2  Stacte doth sons produce,
 2  Onycha from sin doth loose,
 2  Galbanum all death repels,
 2     In spirit, Lord.
 
Equal proportion,
In resurrection;
Seasoned with salt are they.
Ground into powder fine,
Consumed with fire divine -
O what an incense this,
   Jesus my Lord!
 
 3  Ointment is Christ for us,
 3  Exceeding glorious!
 3  Incense is Christ for God,
 3     Wholly for Him.
 3  Ointment flows down to us,
 3  Christ is our portion thus;
 3  Incense ascends to God,
 3     Fragrant to Him.
 
'Tis by th' anointing
Christ we experience
And then the incense burn.
Christ in our prayer and praise -
O what a Christ we raise
From our experience,
   Precious to God.

 1  The Holy Spirit is the seal,
 1  The foretaste, earnest, and the pledge.
 1  He designates us as God's own
 1  And guarantees our heritage.
 
 2  'Twas after we believed in Christ,
 2  The word of truth, the gospel, heard,
 2  The Holy Spirit us did seal
 2  To show that we belong to God.
 
 3  This Spirit as the living seal,
 3  To us God's image now imparts;
 3  Conforming us unto the Son,
 3  He stamps His image in our hearts.
 
 4  This Spirit also is the pledge,
 4  Our earnest and our foretaste true.
 4  He witnesses that we are sons,
 4  With God's inheritance in view.
 
 5  'Tis by this Spirit God does spread
 5  Into our mind, emotion, will;
 5  By sealing every inward part,
 5  He will our very being fill.
 
 6  Oh, Lord, we would cooperate
 6  With all Thy Spirit's inward move;
 6  That we'd become Thy masterpiece,
 6  Th' eternal purpose thus to prove.

 1  Praise the Lord, who firmly joined us
 1     Unto the Anointed One.
 1  Thus we all have been anointed
 1     With th' anointing of the Son.
 
 2  Now in Christ, in the anointing,
 2     We are the anointed ones.
 2  Oh, how blessed is this ointment
 2     Poured upon the many sons!
 
 3  Hallelujah, the anointing
 3     Unto us God's essence brings;
 3  It is now abiding in us,
 3     And it teaches us all things.
 
 4  We're the Lord's peculiar treasure,
 4     Purchased by His precious blood.
 4  He has put His seal upon us,
 4     We are those marked out by God.
 
 5  Day by day we're under sealing,
 5     That we may His likeness share.
 5  By the impress of His Person
 5     We will Jesus' image bear.
 
 6  Now we have the pledge, the foretaste,
 6     Of the Christ we soon will see.
 6  We are longing for the full taste -
 6     God, our feast eternally.
 
 7  God has wrought us for this purpose,
 7     Giving us the earnest here,
 7  Guarantee of full enjoyment
 7     Of our Lord Himself, so dear.
 
 8  The anointing, seal, and earnest -
 8     In our spirit are all three.
 8  Such a wondrous, blest deposit
 8     God has given you and me.

 1  "Seven Spirits" of our God -
 1  Lo, the age has now been turned
 1  To the Spirit with the Son.
 1  For the churches He's concerned.
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!
 
 2  Sevenfold the Spirit is
 2  For the deadness of the church,
 2  That the saints may turn and live,
 2  That the Lord may burn and search.
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!
 
 3  Now the Spirit of our God
 3  Has become intensified:
 3  'Tis not one but sevenfold
 3  That the church may be supplied!
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!
 
 4  Now the seven Spirits are
 4  Seven lamps of burning fire,
 4  Not to teach us, but to burn,
 4  Satisfying God's desire.
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!
 
 5  See the seven Spirits now -
 5  Seven piercing, searching eyes.
 5  In the church exposing us,
 5  All the church He purifies.
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!
 
 6  Seven Spirits doth the Lord
 6  For the churches now employ;
 6  All those in the local church
 6  May this Spirit now enjoy.
 
Come, O seven Spirits, come,
Thy recovery work be done!
Burn and search us thoroughly,
All the churches are for Thee.
   Burn us, search us,
All the churches are for Thee!

 1  Of the Spirit, born of Spirit -

 1     This the essence truly His.
 1  In the Spirit, with the Spirit,

 1  Now the Lord is just that Spirit
 1     And in spirit we're the same.
 
 2  Baptized in the Holy Spirit,

 2  All the church is born of Spirit,
 2     All religion is dispersed.
 2  In the Spirit, in the Spirit -

 2  Now the church must be in Spirit,
 2     Not in teaching, form, or creed.
 
 3  The communion of the Spirit

 3  Now the Spirit in the churches

 3  Seven Spirits for the churches
 3     Are our blessed portion here.
 
 4  "Come and drink the living water,"
 4     Say the Spirit and the Bride -
 4  Church and Spirit speak together,
 4     Utterly identified.
 4  Just according to the Spirit
 4     Must be our reality;
 4  Just the Spirit in the churches
 4     Is the Lord's recovery.

 1  What! Not sing of blood divine?
 1  What! Not tell to all mankind?
 1  What! Not speak to hearts unclean
 1  Of the precious living stream.
 
 2  By this blood, God's life released,
 2  Blood surpassing any beast's;
 2  Perfect, spotless Lamb of God,
 2  Incorruptible His blood.
 
 3  Voice it has, this holy blood;
 3  Pow'r possessed to speak with God;
 3  Speaks it for us at the throne
 3  With its glorious virtue shown.
 
 4  Failure on our conscience is -
 4  Conscience means a "knowing this" - Causing us much grief and pain,
 4  Telling us of every stain.
 
 5  All the while we're unaware
 5  Of the blood's effectual prayer.
 5  Jesus' blood speaks of our case,
 5  That we might receive His grace!
 
 6  We need not dead works to bring,
 6  Nor another offering.
 6  Nothing else could please our God,
 6  Heav'n is listening for His blood.
 
 7  In His blood forgiveness shines;
 7  Oh, 'tis glorious to find!
 7  Israel just atonement knew,
 7  We have that and cleansing too.
 
 8  Heart and mind are now at peace
 8  Rest! Our conscience has been reached.
 8  Never more we blush in shame,
 8  We are washed from every stain.
 
 9  Hallelujah! Fathomless!
 9  All that's in His blood for us!
 9  Sing we will, and sing we must;
 9  In His blood is all our trust!

 1  O Jesus Lord, we come to Thee,
 1  Thy presence to enjoy;
 1  Our entrance now with boldness is,
 1  As we Thy blood employ.
 1  Not by our merit do we stand,
 1  Nor in our righteousness,
 1  Thy blood and righteousness we need;
 1  Their worth we now confess.
 
 2  Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,
 2  Are holy, righteous, fair.
 2  We own our sins as crimson are,
 2  We've no excuse to bear.
 2  We have no argument, no plea;
 2  No veil our sin can hide.
 2  But, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood
 2  Is to our sin applied!
 
 3  God has not overlooked our sin,
 3  But judged it once for all;
 3  His righteous fury, not on us,
 3  But on His Lamb did fall.
 3  A new and living way is made -
 3  We stand on legal ground;
 3  Our Surety and our Substitute
 3  Has pardon for us found.
 
 4  O Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,
 4  Redemption now enjoy;
 4  Thy precious blood again we see,
 4  Its virtue now employ.
 4  Dear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,
 4  Unlimited and free.
 4  Oh, Lamb of God, we'll sing Thy praise,

 1  We were held in bondage, toiling down in Egypt land,
 1     Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 1  But the God of Hebrews rescued us from Pharaoh's hand,
 1     Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 
We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 
 2  Now we're on the other side, we'll go back nevermore!
 2     Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 2  Look! Th' Egyptians all are lying dead upon the shore!
 2     Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 
We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 
 3  Brothers, sisters - Hallelujah! Through the sea we've crossed,
 3     Glory to God, Hallelujah!
 3  All the things that used to hold us are forever lost!

We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,

We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.

 1  "So great a salvation," ye saints of the Lord,
 1  To us is revealed in His marvelous Word!
 1  Since all that He is and has done is for us,
 1  We'll give earnest heed to this word glorious.
 
 2  What He is of God and of Man as the Son,
 2  We now may enjoy since with Him we are one;
 2  Our High Priest and Captain - salvation is He!
 2  He'll cause us to grow in His glory to be.
 
 3  He's washed all our sins, purified them fore'er;
 3  Tasted death on the cross, ended slavery there.
 3  He took on our nature, the devil has slain,
 3  And put you and I in His glorious train.
 
 4  So great the extent of salvation to us -
 4  We're partners of Christ in His plan glorious.
 4  He'll bring us to glory and we'll rule with Him,
 4  To the uttermost saved by His working within.
 
 5  To such a salvation our heed we must give,
 5  Lest drifting away or neglecting we live.
 5  Christ now as our life, future ruling with Him,
 5  We'll miss if we miss this salvation within.
 
 6  "So great a salvation" is given to us
 6  That we may be made like our Lord glorious!
 6  By all that He is and by all He has done
 6  We're brought into glory with God's firstborn Son.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 
 1  Sing praise to Christ Who lives in us,
 1  The God of our salvation;
 1  Who saves us by His life divine,
 1  And not by regulation;
 1  After we've worked - done all we can,
 1  His life has power to change a man:
 1  His life divine can change us.
 
 2  He saves us to the uttermost
 2  By His life-giving power;
 2  Transfusing Himself into us,
 2  He saves us hour by hour.
 2  He saved the lost by coming in,
 2  He's saving now from more than sin:
 2  He's saving us to glory!
 
 3  Our Lord was constituted priest
 3  To be a real life-giver;
 3  Life is the nature of this One
 3  Who can from self deliver:
 3  His life is indestructible,
 3  By it He saves us to the full:
 3  Praise God, He's fully able!
 
 4  His life is fully qualified
 4  To bring us through to glory;
 4  Were it not for His tested life,
 4  'Twould be another story:
 4  His life was fully tried on earth,
 4  To crucifixion from His birth:
 4  He passed through death and Hades.
 
 5  He's pledged to save us to the full,
 5  His life is operating;
 5  He's doing everything for us
 5  'Tis all for our perfecting;
 5  Our life's a failure at its best,
 5  Only His life can stand the test:
 5  His life brings full salvation!
 
 6  He's living now to intercede,
 6  Continuing forever;
 6  He undertakes into the age,
 6  His priesthood changes never;
 6  He always lives to intercede,
 6  Such a High Priest is what we need:
 6  He's higher than the heavens.
 
 7  Come forward now to God through Him,
 7  Ne'er shrink back to destruction;
 7  Come forward now to get the life,
 7  Which brings the proper function;
 7  Come forward now the life to take,
 7  By life His people us He'll make,
 7  And swallow death forever.

 1  In a low dungeon, hope we had none;
 1  Tried to believe, but faith didn't come;
 1  God, our sky clearing, Jesus appearing,
 1  We by God were transfused!
 1  We by God were transfused!
 
Propitiation made by the blood,
Jesus' redemption bought us for God!
No condemnation, justification!
We have peace toward God!
We have peace toward God!
 
 2  Born into Adam, dying we were;
 2  We had a sickness no one could cure.
 2  God, His Son sending, old Adam ending;
 2  He is dead, we are free!

Propitiation made by the blood,
Jesus' redemption bought us for God!
No condemnation, justification!
We have peace toward God!
We have peace toward God!
 
 3  Now we're rejoicing, standing in grace,
 3  Oh hallelujah! Sin is erased!
 3  God, in us flowing, in our hearts growing,
 3  We are saved in His life!
 3  We are saved in His life!
 
Propitiation made by the blood,

We have peace toward God!

 1  Lord, teach us how to pray,

 3     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 
 4  Lord, how Your light makes clear
 4  That we could not but e'er fail You;
 4  Yet there's a message true,
 4  The seed of life within us will break through -
 4     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 
 5  Make us in spirit poor;
 5  Lord, take whate'er we think we know.
 5  We'll open to life's flow,
 5  And thus take in the life that makes us grow -
 5     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 
 6  Lord, make us pure in heart;
 6  For we'll be not content until
 6  You all our being fill,
 6  O Lord, renew our mind, emotion, will -
 6     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 
 7  Yes, Lord, impress our heart
 7  That we must take You in each day;
 7  The seed will have its way;
 7  Your growing brings the kingdom here to stay -
 7     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 
 8  Amen! - The growth in life!
 8  There's nothing that Your life can't do;
 8  Our every part renew.
 8  We'll make it, we'll make it just by You.
 8     Lord Jesus, grow in us.
 8     Lord Jesus, grow in us.

 1  Oh, sanctify us, Lord; now add Thyself to us,
 1  In our experience, Thy Person spread in us,
 1  That in reality the church be glorious,
 1  O Lord, do add Thyself, we pray.
 
Oh, sanctify us, Lord, today;
Lord Jesus, You're the only way.
We take Your Person, Lord;
Oh, spread Yourself abroad.
Oh, sanctify us, Lord, today.
 
 2  Oh, purify us, Lord, by speaking in our heart;
 2  Thy living, spoken word this washing will impart.
 2  Increase Thy speaking, Lord, and cleanse our every part.
 2  Oh, purify us, Lord, we pray.
 
Oh, purify us, Lord, today;
Wash all our natural life away.
Speak now Thy words in us,
And make us glorious.
O Lord, do speak in us today.
 
 3  O Lord, do nourish us; You are the food we need;

 1  Oh, Lord, grant us revelation,
 1     Grant us light and sight to see
 1  That as life, within our spirit,
 1     Thou art our reality;
 1  And that from within our spirit,
 1     Now You must possess each part
 1  Spreading out to all our being,
 1     Making home in all our heart.
 
 2  It is not the outward action -
 2     Pure behavior, conduct good,
 2  Proper poise and perfect manners,
 2     Doing what we think we should;
 2  But it's Christ, a living Person,
 2     Mingled thus with us within,
 2  Spreading into all our being,
 2     So that we might live by Him.
 
 3  Oh, Lord, let our every action,
 3     Everything we do and say,
 3  Come from Thee alone, experienced
 3     In a real and inner way.
 3  We reject the empty teachings,
 3     Leave the methods and the strife.
 3  Let our only way of living
 3     Be the overflow of life!
 
 4  Following the inner feeling,
 4     Living in the overflow,
 4  Moving in the rich anointing,
 4     Not by what we think or know,
 4  Nothing through intent or motive,
 4     Or with purpose duly done,
 4  But just following this feeling,
 4     Living by the living One!
 
 5  Thus we're sanctified completely,
 5     Saturated thoroughly;
 5  Not the old religious concept:
 5     Separated doctrinally.
 5  But 'tis Christ Himself within us,
 5     Added to our every part,
 5  All supplying, satisfying,
 5     Making home in all our heart.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  His countenance angels can often behold,
 1  But ne'er taste His love in His grace;
 1  His saints, though they know of His pure boundless love,
 1  Have never yet once seen His face.
 1  His saints will before long His visage behold,
 1  E'en in His bright glory will share;
 1  But Mary, beholding His tears as He wept.
 1  Could touch His heart's agony there.
 1  Could touch His heart's agony there.
 
 2  We'll soon see the Lord, as He is, face to face,
 2  We'll know Him as never before;
 2  But that touch today, healing our broken heart,
 2  In that day will be felt no more.
 2  That day, though our lips offer unceasing praise,
 2  No tears, then, nor prayers fervent burn;
 2  Nor is there the comfort received through much pain,
 2  Nor trust gained through trials to learn,
 2  Nor trust gained through trials to learn.
 
 3  Exceeding in glory, that day we'll be crowned,
 3  Yet there'll be no cross to obey;
 3  The sweet fellowship of His suff'rings for us
 3  We only can share in today.
 3  Once we've that rest entered, no weariness then,
 3  Nor chance will remain to partake
 3  The trials nor the hardships, nor happiness lost,
 3  Nor suffering borne for His sake,
 3  Nor suffering borne for His sake.
 
 4  Oh, chances to suffer for Him are so few,
 4  His shame and derision to bear;
 4  Such blest opportunities soon pass away,
 4  That He in our troubles may share.
 4  All loneliness, misunderstandings and scorn
 4  Despisings and sorrows will flee;
 4  I treasure these blessings, for through them, O Lord,
 4  I enter sweet oneness with Thee,
 4  I enter sweet oneness with Thee.
 
 5  I long to behold, Lord, Thy countenance soon,
 5  What rapture with Thee, Lord, to meet.
 5  But neither seek I all these trials to avoid;
 5  Such times, Lord, are too rare and sweet.
 5  Have mercy on me, fill me with Thy great love,
 5  For Thee, Lord, to live at all cost;
 5  Lest Thy servant, hoping for that blessed day,
 5  That day, regret chances were lost,
 5  That day, regret chances were lost.

 1  Lord, Thou art our consecration,
 1     Thou the consecrated One;
 1  Thou has satisfied the Father -
 1     Consecration thus was done.
 1  When on earth Thou hadst no pleasure,
 1     Save to do the Father's will;
 1  Now Thou livest here within us,
 1     Consecration to fulfill.
 
 2  Lord, we praise Thee for the picture:
 2     Consecration's ram we see,
 2  Burnt for God's full satisfaction,
 2     Eaten and enjoyed to be.
 2  Thou art now our ram, Lord Jesus,
 2     Offered for the will of God;
 2  By Thy consecration, faultless,
 2     We may walk where Thou hast trod.
 
 3  As we eat Thyself, Lord Jesus,
 3     Consecrated we become;
 3  By Thy wondrous life within us,
 3     Thy obedience is our own.
 3  No more need we strive and struggle,
 3     Consecrated try to be;
 3  Consecration dwells within us -
 3     Now our part to eat of Thee.
 
 4  Lord, we praise Thee, consecration
 4     Is nought else but Thee as food:
 4  As we eat Thee and enjoy Thee,
 4     We are all made one with God;
 4  One in will and one in purpose
 4     We become by eating Thee:
 4  As we take and eat Thyself, Lord,
 4     Consecrated we will be.

 1  I will get me to the mountain,
 1     I will get me to the hill;
 1  In Thy death and resurrection,
 1     Jesus, take me deeper still.
 
I will get me to the mountain,
Willingly would get me there.
All my self fore'er forsaking,
One with Thee, O Lord,
   Thy death to share.
 
 2  Still at times I sense the shadows
 2     Of my nature, untransformed;
 2  Lord, I'll go unto the mountain,
 2     To Thy death to be conformed.
 
I will get me to the mountain,
Willingly would get me there.
All my self fore'er forsaking,
One with Thee, O Lord,
   Thy death to share.
 
 3  On the mountain till the daybreak,
 3     Linger I, Lord, thus with Thee,
 3  May Thy all-transforming Spirit
 3     Saturate me thoroughly.
 
I will get me to the mountain,
Willingly would get me there.
All my self fore'er forsaking,
One with Thee, O Lord,
   Thy death to share.
 
 4  Mingled with Thee on the mountain,
 4     Soon my sun begins to shine;
 4  Death has worked her deep impression,
 4     Now my nature's one with Thine.
 
I will get me to the mountain,
Willingly would get me there.
All my self fore'er forsaking,
One with Thee, O Lord,
   Thy death to share.

*Romans 7

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  Our old man has been crucified with Christ;
 1  Yes, all we are in oldness He sufficed
 1  To bring to naught upon the cross that He
 1  Himself as our new Husband fully be
 1           Enjoyed by us.
 
 2  Yes, all our strength of independence died,
 2  For we with Christ were fully crucified.
 2  Now we're so glad to be His proper wife,
 2  Dependently enjoying Him as life
 2           Forevermore.
 
 3  Our dying was not such a sad affair,
 3  The new man was rejoicing to be there;
 3  The old man dead and buried, we were free
 3  To marry Christ, and live eternally,
 3           His wife, fore'er.
 
 4  Now as the new, regenerated man,
 4  We do two things, according to God's plan:
 4  Bear fruit to God and serve in spirit new
 4  So God becomes the fruit of all we do,
 4           And all we are.
 
 5  There are three laws in Romans seven, see -
 5  The law of God; the mind, the good old me;
 5  The sinful law indwelling bodily;
 5  Yet from these all the Lord has set us free,
 5           To live by Him.
 
 6  In Romans eight the law of Spirit is,
 6  Where we're in Christ, and we are fully His,
 6  The law of life has set us wholly free
 6  And Christ becomes our life eternally,
 6           Hallelujah!

 1  We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,
 1  We will sing to the Lord from within,
 1  We will sing hallelujah to Jesus;
 1  And be blent into oneness with Him.
 
 2  We have been many years in religion,
 2  We have been many years in our mind,
 2  We have been many years in emotions,
 2  Always seeking, but never to find.
 
 3  Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,
 3  Now we're learning to take Christ as life;
 3  Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus
 3  And be freed from all struggling and strife.
 
 4  Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,
 4  Hallelujah for newness within.
 4  When we turn from our mind to our spirit,
 4  We enjoy all the riches of Him.

 1  The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,
 1     With God as life complete.
 1  I once was dead, but now I live,
 1     Was starved, but now I eat.
 
 2  'Twas God that brought me to the tree,
 2     With Christ Himself as meat;
 2  How precious did that tree become
 2     When I began to eat.
 
 3  The Lord Himself is food to me,
 3     He is my life supply;
 3  He will my pure enjoyment be,
 3     None else can satisfy.
 
 4  I freely eat this living tree,
 4     For eating is the way
 4  To put God's life inside of me,
 4     To live by Him today.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  In the Word of old, we are clearly told,
 1     In His image God created man.
 1  To express His worth, to subdue the earth,
 1     Have dominion and fulfill His plan.
 
   Image, image,
In His image He created man.
   Image, image,
For dominion, to fulfill His plan.
 
 2  Yet no rules He gave, no instructions, save:
 2     "Every tree shall be to thee for meat."
 2  But one tree, He said, surely makes you dead;
 2     Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.
 
   Knowledge, knowledge,
Fruit of knowledge wasn't meant for meat.
   Knowledge, knowledge,
Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.
 
 3  Midst the garden fair, see the life tree there -
 3     God Himself the tree of life does show.
 3  But the enemy, somehow subtly
 3     Tempted man the other tree to know.
 
   Fallen, fallen,
Man has eaten of the deadly tree.
   Fallen, fallen,
Man requires a full recovery.
 
 4  Then came Jesus Christ as the tree of life,
 4     Satisfying all that God required.
 4  He redeemed the earth, giving man new birth.
 4     And became the food that man desired.
 
   Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus Christ is really good to eat.
   Jesus, Jesus,
He is real drink and real meat.
 
 5  Jesus ne'er designed e'er to feed our mind;
 5     All good knowledge only puffeth up.
 5  But He came, He said, as a feast instead,
 5     Not to analyze, but only sup.
 
   Take Him, take Him,
Wholly satisfying, glorious.
   Take Him, take Him,
Jesus is the tree of life to us.
 
 6  As we eat the Lord, growth He does afford,
 6     Life and numbers soon will be increased.
 6  We must clearly see God's recovery -
 6     Christ is not religion, but a feast.
 
   Eat Him, eat Him,
Christ as life is all the food we need.
   Eat Him, eat Him,
He who eateth Him shall live indeed.
 
 7  Eating is the way to live Christ today,
 7     Of the eating there should be no lack.
 7  As the churches eat, they become complete,
 7     Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.
 
   Eating, eating,
Of our eating there must be no lack.
   Eating, eating,
Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.

 4  This feast is so enjoyable;
 4  To men it's so available,
 4  For God said whosoever will
 4     May come and freely eat.
 
Yes, come and freely eat;
Yes, come and freely eat.
For God said whosoever will
May come and freely eat.

 1  Let us eat Jesus every day,

Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Why should we undernourished be

 2  Let us drink Jesus till we see

Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Why should we ever thirsty be
When we have His humanity?
 
 3  We must eat Jesus till God can

 3  One man expressed for all to see,
 3  One church in each locality.
 
We'll masticate Jesus!
We'll masticate Jesus!
Then to the tent of meeting bring
Jesus, our real meal offering.

 1  Christ is our manna true,
 1  Our bread of life indeed;
 1  He's our supply of nourishment,
 1  As on Him now we feed.
 
 2  From Egypt Israel fled
 2  Into a desert land;
 2  Egyptian food they left behind,
 2  And wandering began.
 
 3  One day, the manna fell,
 3  Oh, what a wondrous feat;
 3  This was the bread the Lord had giv'n
 3  For Israel to eat.
 
 4  Unique this manna is,
 4  It comes with morning dew;
 4  The visit of God's grace it is,
 4  Forever fresh and new.
 
 5  God is majestic, high,
 5  And greater than us all;
 5  But that we may partake of Him,
 5  In Christ, He's fine and small.
 
 6  Though ground, or beat, or baked,
 6  He's so available;
 6  As bread and cakes and wafers fresh,
 6  We eat Him to the full.
 
 7  Manna shows Him to be
 7  The germ of life, the seed;
 7  'Tis God Himself sown into us,
 7  The source of all we need.
 
 8  Between the morning dew
 8  And cold of winter snow,
 8  This manna too is frost which kills
 8  Things negative below.
 
 9  How pure and white and clean;
 9  In type our Christ we see;
 9  As we digest His element,
 9  He washes inwardly.
 
 10  Manna with honey is;
 10  Two lives this type does show;
 10  One for the Lord's redemptive work,
 10  And one His life to grow.
 
 11  By eating more of Christ
 11  We'll be the less opaque;
 11  We'll then appear as bdellium,
 11  Transparent us to make.
 
 12  Lord, as we're eating here
 12  And in the manna see
 12  The riches of this glorious Christ,
 12  We're filled with praise to Thee.

 1  Drink! A river pure and clear that's flowing from the throne;
 1  Eat! The tree of life with fruits abundant, richly grown;
 1  Look! No need of lamp nor sun nor moon to keep it bright, for
 1     Here there is no night!
 
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the Bride:
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him that heareth, cry.
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him who thirsts and will
Take freely the water of life!
 
 2  Christ, our river, Christ, our water, springing from within;
 2  Christ, our tree, and Christ, the fruits, to be enjoyed therein,
 2  Christ, our day, and Christ, our light, and Christ, our morning star:
 2     Christ, our everything!
 
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the Bride:
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him that heareth, cry.
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him who thirsts and will
Take freely the water of life!
 
 3  We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;
 3  "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" - Jesus is so sweet!
 3  We our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.
 3     What a Christ have we!
 
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the Bride:
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him that heareth, cry.
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him who thirsts and will
Take freely the water of life!
 
 4  Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,
 4  Where the brothers all unite and truly are one.
 4  Jesus gets us all together, Him we now display
 4     In the local church.
 
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the Bride:
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him that heareth, cry.
Do come, oh, do come,
Let him who thirsts and will
Take freely the water of life!

 1  To Jesus every day we find our hearts are closer drawn;
 1  He's fairer than the sons of men and fresher than the morn;
 1  He's all that we can say of Him in fairest words and more,
 1  And every day He's dearer than He was the day before!
 
The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!
 
 2  His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,
 2  For here are all His riches, here we've given up our search;
 2  'Tis here He satisfies our longing spirits o'er and o'er,
 2  And every day He's dearer than He was the day before.
 
The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!
 
 3  Now He's the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,
 3  And by His sweet anointing, how His life within us swells!
 3  As with the saints we're meeting, full released our spirits soar,
 3  For now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.
 
The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!
 
 4  The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:
 4  The riches of this Christ, the church His fullness, men must see.
 4  Yes, all we have and all we are, we every day outpour
 4  For His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before.
 
The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!

 1  We have found the Christ who's all in all;
 1     He is everything to us;
 1  O how blest upon His name to call,
 1     How divine, how glorious!
 
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   And the half has never yet been told!
 
 2  We have found that Christ the Spirit is
 2     Who within our spirit dwells;
 2  How available, how near He is,
 2     And His sweetness all excels.
 
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   And the half has never yet been told!
 
 3  We have found the way to live by Christ -
 3     Pray His Word and call His name!
 3  This - the eating, drinking - has sufficed
 3     And its worth we now proclaim.
 
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   And the half has never yet been told!
 
 4  We have found the local church, our home;
 4     We are home and home indeed!
 4  Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
 4     In the church is all we need.
 
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   And the half has never yet been told!
 
 5  We have found that meeting with the saints
 5     Is the greatest joy on earth;
 5  'Tis by this our spirit never faints
 5     And our lives are filled with worth.
 
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
   And the half has never yet been told!

 1  I love Thee, Jesus,
 1  And Thy love to me
 1  Draws me, ever to seek Thee
 1     And run after Thee,
 1  Draws me, ever to seek Thee
 1     And run after Thee.
 1        Thou art beloved,
 1        Yea! Altogether lovely,
 1        The One in whom my heart delighteth.
 
 2  Thy love, Lord Jesus,
 2  Is sweeter than wine,
 2  And Thy fragrance of ointments
 2     My heart doth entwine,
 2  And Thy fragrance of ointments
 2     My heart doth entwine.
 2        A fount in gardens,
 2        A well of living waters,
 2        Which streams and flows from Lebanon's mountains.
 
 3  O come Beloved,
 3  On my garden blow,
 3  That the odor of spices
 3     May break forth and flow,
 3  That the odor of spices
 3     May break forth and flow.
 3        My spouse, My sister,
 3        I'm come into My garden
 3        To feast upon wine, milk and honey.
 
 4  Set me, Lord Jesus,
 4  As seal on Thine heart;
 4  Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,
 4     And love's strong as death.
 4  Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,
 4     And love's strong as death.
 4        Much water cannot
 4        Quench love, nor do floods drown it.
 4        All man could give for love is contemned.

 1  How I love Thee, precious Jesus,
 1     That Thy love laid hold of me;
 1  Thou hast drawn and wooed and kissed me
 1     That a lover I may be!
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 2  As a company of horses,
 2     Thou, O Lord, has likened me,
 2  Strong and swift, with Pharaoh's chariots,
 2     Full of natural energy.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 3  Just a lover with the dove's eyes
 3     Fixed on Him and Him alone;
 3  Changed are all my natural concepts,
 3     Oh, the Lord in me has grown!
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 4  Now a lily of the valley,
 4     Standing out among the thorns,
 4  In the Lord alone I'm trusting,
 4     Of my self-strength I've been shorn.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 5  Make us doves that hide in Thee, Lord;
 5     Bring us to the secret place.
 5  There You find our voices sweet, Lord,
 5     And desire to see our face.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 6  Make us then, Lord, smoking pillars,
 6     Coming from the wilderness.
 6  By Thy death and resurrection
 6     All our natural will suppress.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 7  You desire a couch to rest on -
 7     We become a rest to Thee;
 7  Thou the Person in our being,
 7     Gone our personality.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 8  Now a palanquin You're making -
 8     Nothing natural You'll allow.
 8  For Your move and Your expression
 8     Start this work within us now!
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 9  You supply the wood and pillars
 9     For the structure and support,
 9  Bottom gold and seat of purple
 9     For our King of royal court.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 10  Only this, O Lord, we offer
 10     For Thy palanquin so fine:
 10  Just our love, so pure and fitted,
 10     The interior design.
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.
 
 11  What a sight when our Beloved
 11     Wears a crown upon His brow;
 11  Christ, the Church, are now united -
 11     Boast and glory to Him now!
 
Our Beloved, how we love Him,
   So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
   And are comely in His sight.

 1  To the Lord we're as a garden,
 1     Out from which the spices flow;
 1  All the precious fruits of Jesus
 1     Freely in this garden grow.
 
Spikenard, saffron, henna* flower,
Cinnamon and calamus,
Frankincense and myrrh and aloes;
O Lord, we would ever grow Thee thus.
 
 2  O Lord, come into Thy garden,
 2     Come, Beloved, come and eat
 2  Freely for Thy satisfaction
 2     Of Thy fruit, abundant, sweet.
 
"Yea," Thou answerest, "I am eating
Honeycomb with honey pure."
All sweet spices from Thy garden,
Doth Thy satisfaction, Lord, secure.
 
 3  All the produce of the garden
 3     Is with resurrection filled
 3  That the Lord may have a city,
 3     Fruits of resurrection build.
 
From the garden to the city,
Growth transformed to precious stone;
Christ is thus expressed, reflected -
God in all His glory fully shown.
 
 4  Now the city, fair and comely,
 4     As the dawn, triumphantly,
 4  Is an army strong and mighty
 4     Marching forth in victory.
 
Lo, the city and the army -
Saints transformed in one accord.
What a terror to the devil,
And so beautiful unto the Lord!

 1  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 1     Thou hast won each love from me;
 1  Who like Thee - so fair and comely?
 1     Who like Thee - so sweet and lovely?
 1  Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
 1     None can e'er compete with Thee!
 
 2  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 2     Gladly will I hear Thy call;
 2  Since Thy voice my heart hath entered,
 2     I from all things could but sever;
 2  Void are all my other seekings,
 2     Every pride hath disappeared.
 
 3  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 3     How can I still stubborn be?
 3  At Thy feet cast all my hard'nings,
 3     And return with songs and singings;
 3  'Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,
 3     'Tis my joy to Thee obey.
 
 4  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 4     Thy way only will I choose;
 4  Though in tears while I'm obeying,
 4     Yet I would not change my standing;
 4  All I long for is Thy pleasure,
 4     And the peace Thy love would bring.
 
 5  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 5     When Thy presence does depart,
 5  Seems the dawn has lost its traces,
 5     Hidden are my smiling faces;
 5  All I yearn for is Thy coming
 5     And Thy presence' sweet embrace.
 
 6  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 6     Can I tell it all to Thee?
 6  Thou my love and satisfaction,
 6     Thou my everlasting portion;
 6  Thou art all that I desire,
 6     Nothing else I would pursue.
 
 7  Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
 7     All I have I give to Thee;
 7  Who like Thee - so fair and comely?
 7     Who like Thee - so sweet and lovely?
 7  Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
 7     None can e'er compete with Thee!

 1  Jesus Lord, I'm captured by Thy beauty.
 1     All my heart to Thee I open wide;
 1  Now set free from all religious duty,
 1     Only let me in Thyself abide.
 1  As I'm gazing here upon Thy glory,
 1     Fill my heart with radiancy divine;
 1  Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,
 1     Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.
 
 2  Shining One - how clear the sky above me!
 2     Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!
 2  Holy One, the flames of God consume me,
 2     Till my being glows with Thee alone.
 2  Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,
 2     All self-love and glory sank in shame;
 2  Now my heart its love and praises render,
 2     Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.
 
 3  Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster
 3     Gladly now I break in love for Thee;
 3  I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;
 3     Lord, behold, I've saved the best for Thee.
 3  Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;
 3     Loving Thee, I'm deeply satisfied.
 3  Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,
 3     Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.
 
 4  My Beloved, come on spices' mountain;
 4     How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
 4  Drink, dear Lord, from my heart's flowing fountain,
 4     Till I rest fore'er in Thine embrace.
 4  Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
 4     But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
 4  Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
 4     Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.

 1  Christ will make His seeking lover
 1     Pillar, couch, and palanquin,
 1  E'en a crown, His boast and glory;
 1     He will do it all! Amen!
 
His beloved - how He loves her,
   So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
   She is comely in His sight.
 
 2  But there still remains a shadow;
 2     Christ is still not satisfied.
 2  He must have a growing garden
 2     To become His loving Bride!
 
His beloved - how He loves her,
   So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
   She is comely in His sight.
 
 3  Paradise of pomegranates,
 3     Pleasant fruits, and henna* flowers,
 3  Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:
 3     His enjoyment now - not ours.
 
His beloved - how He loves her,
   So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
   She is comely in His sight.
 
 4  He has come into His garden,
 4     Gathered myrrh and spices there,
 4  Eaten honeycomb and honey;
 4     Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er.
 
His beloved - how He loves her,
   So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
   She is comely in His sight.
 
 5  From the garden comes the city.
 5     All materials thus supplied;
 5  God is satisfied completely,
 5     And the foe is terrified.
 
His beloved - how He loves her,
   So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
   She is comely in His sight.
 
 6  "Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,
 6     Comely as Jerusalem."
 6  O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,
 6     Thou wilt do it all! Amen!

   She is comely in His sight.

 1  We've found the secret of living,
 1  We've seen the vision divine:
 1  We are of God in Christ Jesus,
 1  We're abiding, abiding in the vine.
 
Abiding in the vine,
Abiding in the vine,
All the riches of God's life are mine!
Praise God, He put us here,
Never to leave; oh, we're -
Abiding, abiding in the vine.
 
 2  No more in vain need we struggle,
 2  Trying the way in to find.
 2  Praise God - we're in Him already,
 2  Hallelujah, abiding in the vine.
 
Abiding in the vine,
Abiding in the vine,
All the riches of God's life are mine!
Praise God, He put us here,
Never to leave; oh, we're -
Abiding, abiding in the vine.
 
 3  In us, the ointment is moving,
 3  'Tis the anointing divine;
 3  God's precious essence bestowing,
 3  While abiding, abiding in the vine.
 
Abiding in the vine,
Abiding in the vine,
All the riches of God's life are mine!
Praise God, He put us here,
Never to leave; oh, we're -
Abiding, abiding in the vine.
 
 4  Now in the life-flow we're living,
 4  O how the light in us shines!
 4  Both God and man are at home now
 4  By the mutual abiding in the vine.
 
Abiding in the vine,
Abiding in the vine,
All the riches of God's life are mine!
Praise God, He put us here,
Never to leave; oh, we're -
Abiding, abiding in the vine.

 1  He's the vine and we're the branches,
 1  We should e'er abide in Him,
 1  And let Him abide within us
 1  As the flow of life within.
 
In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
E'er abiding in the vine.
 
 2  As we hear His instant speaking,
 2  He's the rich indwelling Word;
 2  To abide we must be faithful
 2  To the speaking that we've heard.
 
In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
E'er abiding in the vine.
 
 3  For 'tis here we know abiding
 3  In the real and deepest way;
 3  If we love our Lord completely,
 3  We would do whate'er He'd say.
 
In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
E'er abiding in the vine.
 
 4  Then His love abides within us,
 4  And in love abiding, we
 4  Know the joy of life-communion,
 4  Full and perfect harmony.
 
In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
E'er abiding in the vine.
 
 5  Oh, how precious this abiding,
 5  Oh, how intimate and sweet;
 5  As the fruit of life is added,
 5  And our joy is made complete.
 
In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
E'er abiding in the vine.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  Jesus, the all-inclusive land,
 1     Is everything to me:
 1  A Christ of brooks, of depths and streams,
 1     And fountains bubbling free.
 1  Springing from valleys and from hills,
 1  Flowing till every part He fills,
 1  He waters us - how glorious -
 1     By His life!
 
 2  Jesus is now the land of wheat -
 2     Incarnate, crucified.
 2  But resurrection life is He
 2     By barley signified.
 2  He is a land of figs and vines -
 2  Blood of the grape, the cheering wine.
 2  With such supplies He satisfies -
 2     Christ our land!
 
 3  O what a rich, abundant Christ:
 3     Our pomegranate true,
 3  The olive tree whose oil is now
 3     Anointing us anew,
 3  Rich milk and honey He doth bring,
 3  Sweet, satisfying, nourishing.
 3  Our Christ is such; He is so much!
 3     What a Christ!
 
 4  In our good land we eat the bread -
 4     There is no scarcity.
 4  We never lack one thing in Him,
 4     So rich, so full is He.
 4  He is a land so vast, immense;
 4  He is complete in every sense.
 4  How He expands - land of all lands -
 4     In our heart!
 
 5  Christ is a land of iron stones,
 5     Whence comes authority.
 5  We must dig out this solid Christ
 5     To bind His enemy.
 5  Then we must through the sufferings pass
 5  To be refined as burnished brass.
 5  With iron bind, as brass refined,
 5     Is our need.
 
 6  Lord, how we bless Thee for this land,
 6     The all-inclusive Christ!
 6  We've eaten Him, we're filled with Him,
 6     O how He has sufficed!
 6  Teach us to labor constantly
 6  Upon this vast reality;
 6  This is our joy, this our employ -
 6     Christ our land!

We daily labor on the ground;
Then to the meetings we will bring
The topmost Christ, our offering!

 1  God has set the land before us,
 1  And the land we will possess.
 1  God has finally found a people
 1  Tired of the wilderness.
 1  Down with every weight and sin;
 1  Let's go up and enter in.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 2  God has cleared the way before us
 2  Through the victory of His Son;
 2  Raised the Victor's banner o'er us,
 2  All the battles He has won.
 2  All that's left for us to do
 2  Is by faith to follow through.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 3  It's a land of hills and valleys,
 3  Brooks of water flowing free;
 3  Fountains rich with living water,
 3  Streams that flow abundantly.
 3  Brothers, joyfully we stand
 3  In His promise, Christ the land.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 4  God has made the fruit to grow here,
 4  Filled the land with produce sweet:
 4  Olive oil and pomegranates,
 4  Fig trees, honey, vines and wheat.
 4  We need nothing else besides,
 4  All we need the land provides.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 5  We have eaten unto fullness,
 5  And with joy we bless the Lord,
 5  For the good land He has given;
 5  Faithful to His promised Word.
 5  Here we find there is no lack -
 5  Never, never we'll go back!
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 6  All we need to do is labor,
 6  Working on the land each day;
 6  Not expecting 'manna' blessing,
 6  Working in a normal way.
 6  God and man cooperating
 6  While for harvest we are waiting.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.
 
 7  Labor thus will bring the increase
 7  Of the land with all its worth,
 7  And the Lord will have the harvest,
 7  When He comes to reap the earth.
 7  To provide the Lord the way,
 7  We must labor day by day.
 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.

 1  Laboring on the good land, laboring in the morning,
 1  Laboring through the noontime to the early eve,
 1  Laboring for a harvest, reaping all the produce,
 1  Coming to the meeting, bringing in the sheaves.
 
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
 
 2  Reaping wheat and barley, death and resurrection,
 2  Though the loss sustained our old man often grieves;
 2  But in life abundant, life in resurrection,
 2  Coming to the meeting, bringing in the sheaves.
 
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
 
 3  Grain and wine and oil - bringing in the surplus
 3  Of the wheat and barley, vine and olive trees:
 3  Wine to cause rejoicing, oil to give anointing,
 3  Bringing in the top tenth, bringing in the sheaves.
 
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

 1  Laboring on Jesus, the good land so real,
 1  Plowing and planting and watering the field.
 1  He yields the produce of reality,
 1  God reaps the harvest of Jesus in me.
 
O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
Your Person to possess.
 
 2  Laboring on Jesus! My heart has been set,
 2  Labor's begun, and I have no regret,
 2  For with my labor God's sending the rain,
 2  And all my labor on Christ yields much gain.
 
O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
Your Person to possess.
 
 3  Laboring on Jesus this practical way -
 3  Praying His Word in the spirit each day,
 3  Foll'wing His living anointing within,
 3  Built up with others, the church life to win.
 
O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
Your Person to possess.
 
 4  Laboring on Jesus yields reality,
 4  Meetings of fullness for all men to see;
 4  There God and man are indeed satisfied,
 4  And there God's presence cannot be denied.
 
O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
Your Person to possess.
 
 5  Labor on Jesus to have Him increased!
 5  Then seek God's dwelling and come to the feast!
 5  There bring and offer your surplus to God,
 5  There eat the riches, rejoice in the Lord!
 
O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
Your Person to possess.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  Our worship in reality
 1  Is typified in Moses' law:
 1  With Canaan's produce, rich and sweet,
 1  All Israel came and worshipped God.
 
 2  'Tis thus that we must come today
 2  To worship in reality:
 2  When we bring Christ as produce sweet
 2  God fully satisfied will be.
 
 3  The worship that God so desired
 3  Was not with manna sent from heav'n,
 3  But from their labor on the land
 3  The people's gifts to God were giv'n.
 
 4  Thus, what God so desires today.
 4  Are not the miracles so grand,
 4  But daily, normal life in Christ,
 4  As worship, produce of the land.
 
 5  The manna came from God alone;
 5  The produce, from man's work on Him.
 5  So all our worship now must come
 5  From mingling with the Lord within.
 
 6  As day by day we live in Christ,
 6  And take Him as our everything,
 6  The produce of the land comes forth
 6  And worship true to God we'll bring.
 
 7  The manna, Lord, no more we'll seek,
 7  But Christ in all we will apply;
 7  Then we will have some produce sweet,
 7  Thine own dear heart to satisfy.

 1  The Lord is my Shepherd forever,
 1     He maketh me down to lie,
 1  He leads me beside the still waters
 1     O how He does satisfy!
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
 
 2  My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,
 2     My Shepherd, the waters of rest;
 2  I eat of His riches in spirit,
 2     I drink, and O how I am blest!
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

 3     O what a Companion I find!
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
 
 4  A table prepared by my Shepherd
 4     I feast on and Satan destroy;
 4  My head is anointed with oil,
 4     My cup runneth over with joy!
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
 
 5  And now in His house I am dwelling
 5     Enjoying the goodness of God;
 5  My pleasure is far beyond telling,
 5     My pleasure is Jesus my Lord!
 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
   All the days, all the days of my life;

 1  Lo, the conflict of the ages
 1     Is upon us today,
 1  And the forces of rebellion
 1     Are in total array.
 1  The humanity of Jesus
 1     Now the saints must possess,
 1  His true image and dominion
 1     On the earth to express.
 
Let us stand up in Jesus
   In His full human life,
Human virtues prevailing
   'Gainst corruption so rife;
In this wickedness concerted,
In this age perverse, perverted,
The humanity of Jesus
   Must the church now display.
 
 2  Lo, how Satan came to damage
 2     Human life on the earth;
 2  But the Lord in all this ruin
 2     Raised a man full of worth!
 2  From the seed of the woman
 2     God incarnated became
 2  The man Jesus - the last Adam -
 2     To destroy Satan's aim!
 
Let us stand up in Jesus
   In His full human life,
Human virtues prevailing
   'Gainst corruption so rife;
In this wickedness concerted,
In this age perverse, perverted,
The humanity of Jesus
   Must the church now display.
 
 3  It's by calling, drinking, eating
 3     The man Jesus today,
 3  His humanity enjoying
 3     Bruises Satan each day.
 3  To the Lord we must be turning,
 3     All our soul life deny,
 3  To destroy all Satan's working
 3     And the new man supply.
 
Let us stand up in Jesus
   In His full human life,
Human virtues prevailing
   'Gainst corruption so rife;
In this wickedness concerted,
In this age perverse, perverted,
The humanity of Jesus
   Must the church now display.
 
 4  See the ruin of a nation
 4     Going downward in sin;
 4  All humanity is fallen
 4     And corrupted within.
 4  But as children of the kingdom
 4     We are salting the earth;
 4  His humanity preserves us
 4     In the midst of such dearth.
 
Let us stand up in Jesus
   In His full human life,
Human virtues prevailing
   'Gainst corruption so rife;
In this wickedness concerted,
In this age perverse, perverted,
The humanity of Jesus
   Must the church now display.

 1  Grant us the vision clear to see
 1     We need a new humanity;

 2     God's house must have acacia wood!
 2  Christ's human life is balanced and fine,
 2     And it's adorned with gold divine.
 
We want to stand as boards so strong,
   Held by the bars where we belong;
To be the church for which You long -
   One full-grown man!
 
 3  Satan's one aim: to ruin man,
 3     Man, who's the center of God's plan!
 3  But man will rule the earth utterly,
 3     Conquering every enemy.
 
Each time we turn and eat this man
   We put an end to Satan's plan.
Jesus through His humanity
   Has conquered all!

 1  What a victory! What a triumph!
 1  God Himself became a man,
 1  Clothed Himself in human nature
 1  To fulfill His mighty plan.
 1  He through death destroyed the devil;
 1  Risen now, the Son of Man!
 
 2  Jesus by His human virtues
 2  Did the subtle one arrest;
 2  He as man withstood the tempter,
 2  Fully passed through every test.
 2  Now in spirit I can take Him,
 2  All His virtues to possess.
 
 3  In the Spirit of this Jesus
 3  Is His human life so fine.
 3  Human virtues have been added
 3  To the Spirit all divine.
 3  What abundance in this Spirit,
 3  Rich supply for all mankind!
 
 4  How mysterious! Yet how real!
 4  Such a man now lives in me.
 4  Into all my heart He's spreading -
 4  He, my human life, to be.
 4  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 4  I will praise unceasingly.
 
 5  Oh, what wonder! Oh, how glorious!
 5  God in flesh is manifest.
 5  We the members of His Body
 5  His humanity express.
 5  For the building of God's dwelling
 5  We His human life possess.

 1  Oh, Christ in all His glory put on humanity
 1  So He could be my Person, and live instead of me.
 1  A man in life and being, He fully fits my case,
 1  So all His glorious Person can me replace.
 
O Lord, O Lord, You are the man for me!
I take You as my Person, as my full identity.
O Lord, O Lord, subdue my every part,
And every moment, every place, make home in all my heart.
 
 2  Oh, Christ became the Spirit to speak inside of me,
 2  And as the speaking Spirit He speaks unceasingly.
 2  His speaking is the water that washes me within,
 2  Discharging all my oldness, imparting Him.
 
O Lord, O Lord, speak all You want to me.
Your speaking is Your presence - I must have it constantly.
O Lord, O Lord, speak-wash my every part
And by this metabolic change, make home in all my heart.
 
 3  Oh, Christ will come, the Bridegroom, for us, His glorious Bride,
 3  By coming from within us the church is glorified.
 3  His Person is the glory expanding now in us;
 3  This glory is our Person - how glorious!
 
O Lord, O Lord, by Your economy
So flood us with Your glory, saturate us thoroughly.
Come out, come out, break forth in glory here,
And from the church, O glorious One, in glory soon appear.

 1  We have seen Christ is reality:
 1  But it's not sufficient just to see:
 1  He in our experience must be
 1     Everything to us.
 1  We in prayer behold Him face to face,
 1  In the Word and meetings know His grace;
 1  But in daily life, in every place,
 1     What is He to us?
 
Hallelujah! By His light we see
Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be
If we'll only turn to Him at every time, in every day,
Every thing, in every way and -
Be specific for reality!
And be done with generality!
If we'll just apply Him, we will see
   He's everything to us.
 
 2  Life is full of opportunities
 2  Ordered by our Father's hand: we see
 2  Everything's the best that it could be,
 2     So let's gain Christ!
 2  Christ our content and reality
 2  To shine out from us unceasingly:
 2  He must have a way in you and me,
 2     He must have a way.
 
Hallelujah! In the body we
Bear the death of Christ continually:
Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
The outer man is broken down,
The inner man is shining so that -
In these earthen vessels men can see
There's the treasure of reality!
Thus the gospel's glorious light will be
   Shining out from us.
 
Not just doctrines and theology,
But the content of reality:
Christ as everything in you and me
   He's everything to us!

 1  My old man has been crucified with Him,
 1  With all its foul corruption deep within;
 1  And buried too its nature serpentine,
 1  Completely finished - this great fact is mine,
 1     I hold it fast.
 
 2  But there's a Person in my spirit now,
 2  Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low;
 2  Who by the Word's pure milk will grow to be
 2  The overcoming inner man in me
 2     To gain my heart.
 
 3  Christ as my Person must posses my heart
 3  And be preeminent in every part.
 3  The former owner died but haunts it still.
 3  O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will
 3     Now welcome Thee.
 
 4  In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
 4  The human and divine in one accord;
 4  Yet Thou must have a proper faculty
 4  That all Thy glorious personality
 4     May be expressed.
 
 5  So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,
 5  That it may be Thy home in every way,
 5  A place for Thee to come and settle down,
 5  And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
 5     In one new man.

 1  My old person has been nullified;
 1  With my Lord upon the cross he died;
 1  Now in nothing shall he be applied;
 1     He's dead to me.
 1  My new Person in my spirit dwells;
 1  Springing in me as a bubbling well;
 1  Flowing out until each part He fills
 1     With abundant life.
 
Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives;
And my heart to Him I'd daily give;
That my inner man could have a home
And a place to settle down, yes,
A place to call His own, and -
There be my complete reality,
There expressing all He is to me,
Living in my heart abundantly
   As my Person real.
 
 2  By this Person being formed in me,
 2  I'll a member of His Body be,
 2  No more acting individually,
 2     But with the saints.
 2  More and more our Person He must be;
 2  That our natural personality
 2  Be eliminated thoroughly
 2     Till Christ is all.
 
Only Christ, our Person, must remain;
From our aims, our goals we must refrain,
Till the church be only Christ Himself
Built up as the one new man,
Thus fulfilling God's great plan of -
Mingling fully with the human race
To obtain a proper dwelling place,
'Stablishing His kingdom's rule and grace;
   Over all the earth.
 
Not Himself just individually,
But the church together corporately,
Taking Christ as all in all, to be
   The full-grown, perfect man.

 1  Lord, to know Thee as our Person,
 1     Earnestly we seek and pray;
 1  To experience Thy fulness
 1     In a constant inner way.
 1  Never longer only outward
 1     Or with soulish thoughts obsessed,
 1  But, O Lord, in realest contact
 1     We by Thee would be possessed.
 
Lord, Thou art our Person,
   In our inmost being,
May we constantly experience
   This reality.
 
 2  All the world is under darkness,
 2     Driven by the fallen soul,
 2  And the enemy designing
 2     Does the soulish life control.
 2  Such we were till God, through mercy,
 2     Caused His Son to dwell in us;
 2  Now we fully come to know Him
 2     In His church so glorious.
 
Lord, Thou art our Person,
   In our inmost being,
May we constantly experience
   This reality.
 
 3  Once we walked a soulish person,
 3     Wandering in the wilderness,
 3  Never knowing that our spirit
 3     Craved God's fullness to express;
 3  At the moment Jesus entered
 3     Instantly the whole was changed.
 3  Now we're people spirit-centered!
 3     Hallelujah! Rearranged!
 
Lord, Thou art our Person,
   In our inmost being,
May we constantly experience
   This reality.
 
 4  Now our spirit is our person -
 4     What a glorious fact is this!
 4  Christ Himself in us expressing
 4     God's intent and holiness.
 4  Not the soul-life's vain delusion,
 4     But the spirit strengthened is;
 4  Christ Himself is now our Person -
 4     He is ours and we are His.
 
Lord, Thou art our Person,
   In our inmost being,
May we constantly experience
   This reality.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 
 1  On the Lord's day, John, in spirit,
 1  Heard a voice and turned and saw
 1  Seven lampstands brightly shining;
 1  Of pure gold, divine, they were.
 1  In the midst of them, appearing,
 1  He beheld the Son of Man,
 1  Ever for the churches caring,
 1  Tending God's eternal plan.
 
 2  His appearance, lo, how different
 2  From the One John knew before.
 2  Now He's girt in golden raiment,
 2  Not the robe which then He wore.
 2  Girt about the breasts and serving,
 2  He the priesthood fully bears;
 2  Cherishing the lampstands dearly,
 2  He for all the churches cares.
 
 3  Ancient One He is, yet fresher
 3  Than the newly driven snow;
 3  Eyes are as a flaming fire,
 3  Feet as burnished brass aglow.
 3  Tender eyes that gazed at Peter,
 3  Now are as a burning flame;
 3  And the voice that whispered, "Mary,"
 3  Many waters now became.
 
 4  John, once formerly reclining
 4  On His breast, now fell as dead,
 4  When he saw Him thus in spirit,
 4  As He is, exhibited.
 4  Lo, the Christ of Revelation!
 4  See Him, thus intensified,
 4  That the lampstands, His expression,
 4  May be strengthened and supplied.

 1  In Revelation chapter one
 1  God gives a vision of the Son,
 1  Of Him who was and is to come;
 1  Oh, let us to this One now come.
 
 2  In spirit hear His trumpet voice;
 2  We must be turned to see His choice -
 2  The seven lampstands golden fair;
 2  The Son of Man is walking there.
 
 3  The great high priestly robe He wears,
 3  For every church He fully cares:
 3  He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;
 3  He makes them burn, flames in His eyes.
 
 4  A golden girdle on His breast -
 4  His work is done, and from His rest
 4  He unto all the churches pours
 4  Himself in love, the treasure store.
 
 5  His head, His hair is white as wool -
 5  The ancient One with youth is full.
 5  His face is shining as the sun
 5  To burn and lighten every one.
 
 6  Oh, when this living One we see,
 6  We'll fall as dead, we'll finished be.
 6  But then the Lord His comfort gives -
 6  He once was dead, but now He lives.
 
 7  Let every church just love Him more -
 7  His riches then He will outpour.
 7  All others loves now lay aside;
 7  Let's take this Jesus, none beside.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  In the multitude he lay there
 1  With a sickness many years;
 1  Impotent and lying helpless,
 1  Every fraught with many fears.
 1  Waiting for the water's moving,
 1  Waiting for the angel's stir;
 1  Powerless to move, however,
 1  Helpless, hopeless, lying there.
 
 2  At this pool how clear the picture
 2  Of the hopeless case of all
 2  Who are seeking self-perfection
 2  To recover from the fall.
 2  Though the law is good and holy,
 2  Flesh, to keep the law, is dead;
 2  What we need is not religion,
 2  But the Word of life instead.
 
 3  Though it's feast day, he's not happy,
 3  Though the Sabbath, there's no rest;
 3  Lying in his poor condition,
 3  Miserable and sore depressed.
 3  At that moment Jesus saw him,
 3  Knowing he was thus so long.
 3  "Will you be made whole?" He asked him,
 3  "Healed and walking, well and strong?'
 
 4  Though he told his hopeless story,
 4  Scarce believing what he'd heard,
 4  Yet, soon to his feet arising,
 4  He received the living word.
 4  This is all our situation,
 4  We - like him - were lying there
 4  In the sheep-fold of religion,
 4  Under law's prevailing care.
 
 5  While we yet were weak and helpless,
 5  Christ the Son of God did come.
 5  By His word we're now enlivened;
 5  He's the life-imparting One!
 5  Hallelujah for this Jesus,
 5  He's the Word of life to men;
 5  For law's bondage He releases,
 5  Death is turned to life again!

 1  "Art thou the Coming One?' they asked,
 1  To which he made reply:
 1  "I'm not the Christ - I am not He -
 1  A voice, that's all, am I."
 
 2  And on the morrow, John stood there
 2  And spoke to two or three.
 2  And as he lifted up his eyes,
 2  He then did Jesus see.
 2  He said, "Behold the Lamb of God,
 2  'Tis He Who walks this way.
 2  He's here to take the sins of all
 2  And bear them all away!"
 
 3  Yet poor religion counted not
 3  These things of any worth,
 3  But seeking for a leader great
 3  It lingered on in dearth;
 3  And looking for a movement strong,
 3  Continued in its strife.
 3  Preoccupied with these things,
 3  They missed the Lord of LIFE!
 
 4  Religion is Christ's enemy,
 4  It's even so today.
 4  For though they name Him, should He come,
 4  They'd put the Lord away.
 4  They did it then, they'd do it now,
 4  They'd miss the Lord again.
 4  So let us seek the Lord Himself,
 4  The lamb, the dove obtain.
 
 5  Now in the Lord's recovery
 5  We're drawn to Christ alone.
 5  The Spirit as the gentle dove
 5  Has found in us a home.
 5  Let all religion turn away
 5  To movements wide and great;
 5  This testimony of Himself
 5  Our Lord will vindicate!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 
 1  Your ministry, O Lord,
 1     How excellent it is;
 1  A better covenant,
 1     And better promises;
 1  Enacted on a better law.
 1  Of such You are Executor.
 
 2  A better covenant,
 2     And better promises;
 2  A better law of life
 2     And sacrifice this is.
 2  Redemption's work, done long ago,
 2  A better blood has made it so.
 
 3  In Hebrews eight we see
 3     The way to make us whole;
 3  Life planted deep within,
 3     Which spreads into the soul.
 3  The law of life, imparted, still
 3  Inscribed in mind, emotion, will.
 
 4  The law of letters leave,
 4     The law of life pursue;
 4  The one is old and dead,
 4     The other fresh and new.
 4  Dead teachings cannot help the seed;
 4  The law of life is what we need.
 
 5  The law of life in us,
 5     In function now we see,
 5  Works not by will and thought
 5     But automatically.
 5  It saturates, conforms to Him;
 5  The standard model spreads within.
 
 6  Our sins are all forgiv'n,
 6     His life imparted too;
 6  God is our God today,
 6     And we're His people true.
 6  We know Him in an inward way:
 6  These blessings four have come to stay.
 
 7  We're being sonized now;
 7     The life within will do
 7  The deep transforming work
 7     Of making us anew.
 7  In ages past, the work was done -
 7  Now prayer is over - praise the Son!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  Upon the throne of Jesus Christ
 1     We've taken up our seat.
 1  The world and Satan, sin and self
 1     Are all beneath our feet!
 1  Christ's finished work did put us here,
 1     When once for all He died;
 1  No more are we the sinners poor,
 1     We're fully glorified.
 
 2  We're dwelling in the house of God,
 2     The church life glorious.
 2  The shrinking-back, low Christian life,
 2     Is not the life for us!
 2  We're passing through the Holy Place
 2     Of mind, emotion, will;
 2  We're dwelling in the Holiest
 2     Where God our being fills.
 
 3  We're under the New Covenant,
 3     With glorious items, three:
 3  The law of life, spontaneous,
 3     Transforming utterly;
 3  We are His people, He's our God -
 3     Oh, bless'd reality;
 3  We all are fully able now
 3     To know God inwardly.
 
 4  A supplement God added then;
 4     This item we must know:
 4  Christ Jesus did put sin away
 4     Two thousand years ago.
 4  No memory of sin at all,
 4     It's hist'ry, done and gone;
 4  In spirit now the law of life
 4     Will take us swiftly on.
 
 5  Two things accomplished by our Lord
 5     On Calvary's cross, we see:
 5  The law of life, the end of sin!
 5     Our God's economy.
 5  Since all His work was finished there,
 5     He entered into rest;
 5  Now on the throne He prays that we
 5     Will take our full bequest.
 
 6  We'll drop our former concepts, Lord,
 6     To take this finished way;
 6  Appropriating each bequest,
 6     We'll praise You more each day.
 6  We'll heed our High Priest's inward call -
 6     "Come forward!" to the end -
 6  Until we reach the final goal;
 6     The New Jerusalem!

 1  Son of Man, Son of Man on the throne today;
 1  Son of Man, Pioneer, He has led the way;
 1  Following, how we sing, Jesus leads us on;
 1  We are marching with the Victor to the throne.
 
 2  On we go, on we go to the throne with Him;
 2  On we go, through this age, age so dark and grim;
 2  Then shall we - formerly, Satan's captured ones -
 2  Be exalted with the Lord upon His throne.
 
 3  Called as sons, called as sons, destined to be kings;
 3  Called as sons, we've no time for the worldly things:
 3  Yet we know, it is so - we don't qualify!
 3  Thus the Lord must search and burn and purify.
 
 4  Search and burn, search and burn all our inward parts;
 4  Search and burn, thoroughly, to refine our hearts;
 4  We'll not fear, but be clear - burning, searching thus
 4  Is the gracious visit of the Lord to us.
 
 5  With the Man, with the Man is a rainbow fair;
 5  Glorious bow, 'round the throne, faithfulness declares:
 5  We deserved to be served with God's judgment sore.
 5  But we have been spared to praise Him more and more.

 1  O Lord, You've called to us, and Canaan we would win,
 1  To be Your corporate man and dwell with You therein;
 1  But how the darkness of this world does hold us in -
 1     O Lord, appear to us, we pray.
 
O Lord, appear to us today;
We see this is the only way.
The idols to forsake
And Canaan land partake,
O Lord, appear to us today.
 
 2  O God of glory, shine; draw and we'll follow You.
 2  Our strength and motive be, it's nothing we could do.
 2  Your light attracts us, Lord, 'til all else fades from view -
 2     O Lord, do shine on us, we pray.
 
O Lord, do shine on us today;
Till all our background fades away,
Till You alone we see,
Shining so gloriously -
O Lord, do shine on us today.
 
 3  In Your appearing, Lord, we have Your speaking clear;
 3  Your word empowers us and drives away all fear.
 3  So, Lord, keep calling us, Your voice we need to hear.
 3     O Lord, do speak to us, we pray.
 
O Lord, do speak in us today;
You know the words You need to say.
To open all our heart,
Your very Self impart.
O Lord, do speak in us today.
 
 4  O Lord, it's not of us, we've seen it's all of You;
 4  You are the calling One, Originator too!
 4  We can receive this call by our beholding You -
 4     O God of glory, come, we pray.
 
O God of glory, come today;
We've seen this is the only way
To answer Your dear call
That You might be our all -
O God of glory, come today.

 1  From my spirit within flows a fountain of life -
 1     The Triune God flowing in me;
 1  God the Father's the source,
 1     Christ the Son is the course,
 1  And the Spirit imparts life to me.
 
Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,

O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;
   At Your coming may life be my crown.
 
 2  In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;
 2     He leads me by waters of rest;
 2  No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;
 2     In the flow I am perfectly blessed.
 
Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,
   And my soul-life at last I lay down;
O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;
   At Your coming may life be my crown.
 
 3  Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,

Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,

 1  Chapter one of Genesis:
 1  Life is God's one emphasis,
 1  Showing Christ subjectively,
 1  Step by step He grows in me.
 
 2  Just as earth became a waste,
 2  Death and darkness once I faced.
 2  God had judged, no light did shine;
 2  Hollowness and void were mine.
 
 3  Satan's fall had filled the seas
 3  With corruption, sin, disease.
 3  Yet the Spirit brooded o'er
 3  The abyss: chaos no more!
 
 4  God then spoke: the air was cleared!
 4  Darkness which I once had feared
 4  Was dispelled by God's own light.
 4  A new day! No longer night!
 
 5  As the light began to shine
 5  His discernment became mine.
 5  I began to see aright;
 5  God divided dark from light.
 
 6  Then the waters He did split;
 6  An expanse between them fit,
 6  Earthly things from heavenly,
 6  Separated hence they'd be.
 
 7  On the third day God designed
 7  That the waters be confined.
 7  In our lives dry land must be;
 7  No more death and no more sea!
 
 8  God commands: death's water halt!
 8  Christ, the good land, we exalt!
 8  Separated from all strife
 8  We enjoy Christ as our life.
 
 9  Growing in us inwardly;
 9  Grass, then herb, then fruitful tree.
 9  We begin as but a blade;
 9  Soon our being He'll pervade.
 
 10  Then the fourth day lights He set;
 10  Bearers these, more definite.
 10  Richer light to radiate,
 10  Higher life to generate.
 
 11  Sun, the greater light we see
 11  Ruling day triumphantly;
 11  Yet when darkness fills the skies,
 11  Waxing moon is on the rise!
 
 12  'Tis the Church she typifies;
 12  For her light on Christ relies.
 12  In His image meant to be,
 12  She reflects Christ perfectly.
 
 13  Lastly, precious stars He placed,
 13  Strong in spirit, full of grace;
 13  Shining when the moon seems faint,
 13  These are overcoming saints.
 
 14  What a glorious picture here:
 14  Sun and moon and stars appear!
 14  Lord, our prayer is that we'd be
 14  Full of light and life in Thee.

 1  Life is God the Father in Christ Jesus
 1  As the Spirit flowing into us.
 1  How enjoyable, this Person wonderful!
 1  He's our life so rich and bountiful.
 
 2  We experienced regeneration
 2  When we opened to this living One.
 2  We were born again; another life came in.
 2  Now it floods us till we're full of Him.
 
 3  He within us is the living Spirit
 3  In our spirit, flowing out of it
 3  Into all our heart, transforming every part
 3  By the life which He Himself imparts.
 
 4  Now He must have our cooperation.
 4  We must set our mind upon the Son.
 4  We must turn away from all that leads astray,
 4  Till our mind is set on Him each day.
 
 5  Lord, our human spirit now contains You.
 5  Still Your purpose in us You would do;
 5  If our wandering mind would leave old thoughts behind,
 5  Then Your life and peace in it we'll find.
 
 6  Lord, we would our every thought be captured
 6  By the rich enjoyment in Your Word.
 6  In it we're supplied, our mind there will abide,
 6  Till our thoughts are wholly sanctified.
 
 7  Let's keep practicing the application
 7  Of this life by minding just the Son.
 7  Praise Him for the way to live by Him today!
 7  Lord, on You our minds will ever stay.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  There are two lines to live by in our living today -
 1  One the life line to bring us into Christ all the way.
 1  But the other is knowledge which will make us die;
 1  We must be very careful on which line we abide.
 
Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
   We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
   Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.
 
 2  Lord, we would be as Abel, fully contacting You;
 2  Not by knowledge or concept, but by life fresh and new.
 2  Just as Enosh began to call upon Your name,
 2  And as Enoch who walked with You, we'll do just the same.
 
Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
   We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
   Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.
 
 3  Keep us living and walking as did old Abraham;
 3  In Your holy appearing to be transfused like him.
 3  As did Isaac and Jacob, Moses lived this way -
 3  So dependent upon Your presence with him each day.
 
Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
   We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
   Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.
 
 4  Full enjoyment had David, ate the life-giving tree.
 4  Daniel prayed to his God and lived by Him constantly.
 4  Jesus lived by the Father to be life complete;
 4  Now as His living Body of the life tree we'll eat.
 
Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
   We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
   Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12 
 
 1  Life is mysterious, life is God Himself,
 1  Whose whole intention focuses on man.
 1  God made him to take in the tree of life,
 1  To have a man of life for His own plan.
 
 2  But man was tempted and seduced to sin,
 2  By taking knowledge from the other source.
 2  This man then fell as knowledge entered in
 2  And dominated him with all its force.
 
 3  This knowledge has developed in the man
 3  Into the human culture on the earth.
 3  So man, created to fulfill God's plan,
 3  Became a failure full of Satan's dearth.
 
 4  Then God came in the Person of the Son;
 4  Lived He on earth, Christ Jesus was His name -
 4  A living model so that everyone
 4  Could live by life, God's fullness to obtain.
 
 5  This God-man, Christ, went to the cross and died,
 5  By death He ended knowledge, the old man.
 5  Things negative forever crucified,
 5  Death He subdued, a new life He began!
 
 6  From death He resurrected and became
 6  The living Spirit to give life to us.
 6  When we believe and call upon His name;
 6  This living Spirit comes to dwell in us.
 
 7  By this the very Triune God is now
 7  The living Spirit mingling deep within.
 7  Our spirit joins in oneness; this is how
 7  We are one spirit evermore with Him.
 
 8  'Tis by this Spirit that we walk and act,
 8  We have our being, think, and see all things;
 8  We're now within this Spirit! What a fact!
 8  This Spirit to us all God's fullness brings!
 
 9  So now we have to set our mind on Him;
 9  Each day, each hour, our mind on Him must be;
 9  That by this Spirit we'd be saved within
 9  By life and reign in life eternally.
 
 10  'Tis by this Spirit that we shall be freed
 10  From Sin whose law inside us death would bring.
 10  Our mortal bodies will have life indeed;
 10  Thus sanctified we'll be in everything.
 
 11  This Spirit shall transform our natural life,
 11  Save us from self, build us in one new man,
 11  Till we're conformed to be like Jesus Christ,
 11  Thus finishing our God's eternal plan.
 
 12  Life is our God and life is Christ our Lord.
 12  Life is the Spirit. Life's the only way -
 12  Till we're transfigured and redeemed to God.
 12  We're waiting, looking forward to that day!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  A mighty flowing-out is God,
 1  He flows throughout the ages.
 1  And so to flow Himself to man
 1  He is in many stages;
 1  Yet still one God is He,
 1  One flow eternally;
 1  His stages pave the way
 1  To flow through man today,
 1  And now He flows within us!
 
 2  In the beginning we can see,
 2  God as a flowing river,
 2  The river to convey the tree,
 2  Himself as life deliver.
 2  And at the end the same,
 2  The river doth remain,
 2  God in the Lamb doth flow,
 2  The tree prevails to grow,
 2  And God flows on forever.
 
 3  God flowed Himself into a man,
 3  The man we call Christ Jesus.
 3  He gave up His own life for man
 3  And God's own life releases.
 3  Though Satan did his best
 3  To put God's flow to rest -
 3  He had Him crucified
 3  And cruelly pierced His side -
 3  But out came blood and water!
 
 4  The blood and water flowed from Him,
 4  In streams of pure salvation.
 4  The blood brings cleansing from all sin;
 4  Water, regeneration.
 4  And now the Spirit flows,
 4  Brings God where'er He goes.
 4  All he could do, the foe,
 4  Was just release the flow.
 4  And God just keeps on flowing.

 1  God's intention in this universe is with humanity,

Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Yes, mingling is the way!
 
 2  In the center of our being, past our mind, emotion, will,
 2  Is a certain spot created to contain the Lord until
 2  By His flowing and His flooding He will all our being fill;
 2     Yes, mingling is the way.
 
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,

 4  God's intention He's accomplishing - a corporate entity;
 4     Yes, mingling is the way.
 
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Yes, mingling is the way!
 
 5  In our daily life and all we are and do and think and say,

 5     Yes, mingling is the way.
 
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Yes, mingling is the way!
 
 6  From the fruit of daily living, New Jerusalem we'll see,
 6  It's the ultimate in mingling - it's divine humanity.
 6  And what joy that we can share it all, and share it corporately.
 6     Yes, mingling is the way.
 
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Yes, mingling is the way!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  There's a stormy wind a-blowing from the north;
 1     Let it blow! Let it blow!
 1  God as our exp'rience will the wind bring forth;
 1     Let it blow! Let it blow!
 
Let it blow! the rushing mighty wind;
   Let it blow us into life!
Let it blow! the gracious wind of God;
   Let it blow us into Christ!
 
 2  There's a hov'ring cloud a-following the wind,
 2     Covering us! Covering us!
 2  And the presence of the Lord the cloud does bring,
 2     Covering us! Covering us!
 
Covering us, God's overshadowing cloud -
   God has come to stay with us.
Covering us, the gracious cloud of God -
   Strength and comfort glorious!
 
 3  With the cloud continually a fire does flash
 3     Burning us! Burning us!
 3  It exposes sin, the soul life, and the flesh,
 3     Burning us! Burning us!
 
Let it burn! the jealous flame of God;
   Let it burn continually!
Let it burn! this all-consuming flame;
   Let it burn us thoroughly!
 
 4  Then from out the fire does the electrum glow,
 4     Shining forth! Shining forth!
 4  The redeeming God does our experience show,
 4     Shining forth! Shining forth!
 
Let Him shine! This gold and silver One;
   Let Him shine for all to see!
'Tis the Lamb-God who has now become
   Our enjoyment inwardly.
 
 5  Let the wind, cloud, fire and th' electrum be
 5     Wrought in us, o'er and o'er;
 5  Let this cycle be repeated constantly
 5     More and more, more and more!
 
Blow and hover, burn and shine forth, Lord,
   All our being to possess,
That we all may gain Thee constantly
   All Thy likeness to express.

*Ezekiel 1:4-10

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  From the north where God is dwelling
 1  Comes a rushing, stormy gale.
 1  Now the mighty Spirit blowing
 1  All our being does assail.
 1  We are stirred to our foundations -
 1  How this wind awakens us!
 1  Thus we're open for God's dealings,
 1  And the cloud descends on us.
 
 2  With the cloud we have His presence
 2  Sweetly hov'ring over us;
 2  So enveloped by His nearness;
 2  In the Lord we put our trust.
 2  But the cloud brings with it fire
 2  To consume our selfish lusts;
 2  That as ashes something higher
 2  May be added into us.
 
 3  Then from out the flashing fire
 3  Comes th' electrum glowing bright.
 3  God as gold and man as silver
 3  Now are mingled. What a sight!
 3  This bright metal, O Lord Jesus,
 3  Is Thyself, Lamb-God sublime.
 3  O Lord, work Thyself within us
 3  Till th' electrum in us shines.
 
 4  By our passing through this cycle,
 4  Living creatures we become
 4  To express the life of Jesus;
 4  He with whom we've been made one.
 4  We express Him as a human,
 4  As a man so good and fine;
 4  Balanced, normal, never striving;
 4  Fully human, yet divine.
 
 5  We express Him as a lion
 5  Conquering every enemy;
 5  As an ox obedient, lowly,
 5  Faithful in His ministry.
 5  We express Him as an eagle,
 5  So transcendent, soaring high;
 5  Never held by fear or flatter,
 5  He above it all does fly.
 
 6  Hallelujah! What a figure
 6  Of the way God deals with us!
 6  From the wind, cloud, fire, electrum,
 6  To the creatures glorious:
 6  As the man, the ox and lion,
 6  As the eagle - all the four
 6  Will be our complete expression
 6  As we eat Him more and more.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  God in His justifying has a plan,
 1  A deeper purpose for a corporate man.
 1  When we were called, this mighty Lord of all
 1  Appeared to us to save us from the fall.
 
 2  We walked as strangers unaware of Him,
 2  But in His glory God shined deep within,
 2  Infusing His own element in us;
 2  This precious essence was our Lord Jesus.
 
 3  What glory! How attractive was this light!
 3  How we appreciated such a sight!
 3  Our first reaction was belief in Him -
 3  This precious God has placed Himself within.
 
 4  Our first reflection of this element
 4  Reflected Jesus back to God, Who sent
 4  His own response to count as righteousness
 4  Our faith in Him Who was infused in us.
 
 5  But we would hold to this reality,
 5  Our Jesus Christ in us our all to be,
 5  Enjoying all He is abundantly,
 5  Content to have this One eternally.
 
 6  Thus God could never be so satisfied;
 6  Knowing that we cared only to abide
 6  In our experiences of His Son,
 6  Not caring for His goal to make us one.
 
 7  Still He would seek those faithful saints who'd hear
 7  His call to give up everything so dear,
 7  To offer up their individual Christ;
 7  To come together for the Body life.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 
 1  God is righteous in His doings,
 1  He is perfect in His ways;
 1  Just is He in all His actions,
 1  And He well deserves our praise.
 1  Righteous was His condemnation,
 1  Righteous His requirement;
 1  For the law had deemed us sinners,
 1  And for judgment we were meant.
 
 2  Oh, how blest the love that spared us,
 2  For the law had judged us dead.
 2  God, to meet the righteous judgment,
 2  Passed it on His Son instead.
 2  Hallelujah! Our Redeemer,
 2  Christ, to God has purchased us;
 2  Now enjoying His redemption,
 2  We become God's righteousness.
 
 3  God is holy in His nature,
 3  Holiness is what He is.
 3  In this way He sanctified us,
 3  Makes our nature one with His.
 3  Spreading from our quickened spirit,
 3  He renews each inward part,
 3  Moving into all our being,
 3  Making home in all our heart.
 
 4  Oh, how blessed is this process!
 4  It's the Lord's life-saving way.
 4  It's our constant, real experience;
 4  It's our life from day to day.
 4  As we're minding just the spirit,
 4  Then the mind is life to us,
 4  And the Lord in us is gaining
 4  Transformation marvelous!
 
 5  Glory is God's true expression,
 5  All He is, in full, expressed;
 5  Final stage of our redemption,
 5  Bodily made manifest.
 5  Glory is the consummation
 5  Of this life which sanctifies;
 5  Our complete transfiguration
 5  Is the goal which life supplies.
 
 6  'Tis for this we wait, expecting
 6  To be raptured, glorified.
 6  Then the earth will see God's fullness;
 6  Christ completely testified.
 6  We fore'er will just express Him,
 6  Nature will rejoice to see
 6  All the sons of God in glory
 6  Manifested finally.
 
 7  By His mercy, we're selected,
 7  Ours a glorious destiny.
 7  Not by running, nor by willing,
 7  But through God's own sovereignty.
 7  Once we were wild olive branches,
 7  Now the root and fat partake,
 7  Grafted in, rejoice together,
 7  Growing for the kingdom's sake.
 
 8  As we're daily in this process
 8  And by life are sanctified,
 8  How we thank Him for the blessing
 8  Of the church life He's supplied.
 8  Here God is our full enjoyment,
 8  Practical and real to us;
 8  Sons we are, and heirs together,
 8  In the church life, glorious!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah for the cross!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
It shall never suffer loss!

 1  There's a way before us and a race to run -
 1     Christ our way, Christ our way!
 1  Turn away from everything distracting us -
 1     Run the race, run the race!
 1  From the altar through the Holy Place,
 1     Through the veil into our God,
 1  To the law of life within the ark;
 1     'Tis the goal, our great reward.
 
 2  There's a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
 2     Urging us, forward come!
 2  There is Abel, Enoch, Jacob, Abraham,
 2     Moses, David, Solomon.
 2  John the Baptist greater than them all,
 2     Even he bids forward come!
 2  These all died in faith, receiving not
 2     Promises that were to come.
 
 3  The Old Testament believers give the call,
 3     "Forward come, forward come!"
 3  For complete perfection they depend on us
 3     Going on! Going on!
 3  We are at the consummation now
 3     Of our God's economy;
 3  Better things we are experiencing.
 3     Praise the Lord - reality!
 
 4  E'en the least of us is greater than their great.
 4     We're not small, we're not small!
 4  They are waiting, watching, and expecting us.
 4     "Forward come!" hear their call!
 4  They have run the race and for their sakes
 4     We'll obey the law of life.
 4  Till the day we'll all be joined in one
 4     To express God's glorious Christ.

 1  Years I spent in sorrow 'round the cross,
 1  Still repenting over sins and dross.
 1  Then at last the river I did cross,
 1     To touch the throne.
 
Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace -
That I find of Him to run the race!
Boldly now I come again to taste
   My glorious Lord.
 
 2  In my Christian life I'd daily fall,
 2  So I answered every altar-call,
 2  Till I left the altar, left it all,
 2     To touch the throne.
 
Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace -
That I find of Him to run the race!
Boldly now I come again to taste
   My glorious Lord.
 
 3  Brothers, to the Holiest forward come;
 3  Leave your sins behind, the race now run.
 3  Hallelujah! All the work is done -
 3     The veil is gone!
 
Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace -
That I find of Him to run the race!
Boldly now I come again to taste
   My glorious Lord.
 
 4  Now within the veil, enjoying God,
 4  Manna, law of life, and budding rod;

 1     Praise God for tidings glad -
 1     We're at the throne of grace;
 1     Our gospel's not so low,
 1     We're in the highest place.
 1  We're meeting here around the throne,
 1  Enjoying God with all His own.
 
 2     Start in the outer court,
 2     But aim to get inside;
 2     The Holy Place is good,
 2     But do not there abide.
 2  Leave sin behind - it's put away;
 2  We're in the veil with God to stay.
 
 3     To rise from earth to heav'n,
 3     A deeper turn we need;
 3     To be where Christ is now
 3     Upon the throne indeed.
 3  We're gathered at the throne of grace,
 3  Beholding Jesus face to face.
 
 4     We're being turned as one,
 4     Not individually;
 4     Not private Christians now.
 4     But Body Christians we.
 4  As members here in one accord,
 4  We are the Body of the Lord.
 
 5     As Body Christians now
 5     We have a higher word.
 5     Foundation's word we see,
 5     'Tis altar, cross, and blood.
 5  Perfection's word is little known,
 5  'Tis fellowship around the throne.
 
 6     Christ is objective too,
 6     But subjective are we
 6     In our experience;
 6     Our spirit is the key.
 6  God, throne, and holiest - we see
 6  Our spirit now contains all three.
 
 7     Leviticus is past,
 7     And Aaron's work is o'er;
 7     Melchisedec is here,
 7     High Priest forevermore;
 7  His ministry is now so fine:
 7  He comes to feed us bread and wine.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  Through God's word, my hope at His returning
 1  Is that all my being be redeemed;
 1  Yet in times of grief and tribulation,
 1  Doubt and fear arise, no hope is seen.
 1  In those hours, when prayer cannot be uttered,
 1  Only groaning from my breast is heard.
 1  Then the Spirit, in like manner, helps me,
 1  Praying in my weakness unto God.
 
 2  Lord, my prayer is not for deeper suffering,
 2  But that from each trial I'd be free.
 2  Let the cup of bitterness be taken;
 2  Yet, Thy will, not mine, dear Lord, must be.
 2  Even now, though trials sore surround me,
 2  Still within my heart there is a peace,
 2  For the love of God outpoured within me
 2  Floods my heart and bids my doubting cease.
 
 3  Blest assurance! God has fully ordered
 3  Every matter by His sovereign hand;
 3  Every person (though we see so dimly),
 3  Every thing's according to His plan.
 3  Every trial is but the Father's answer
 3  To the groaning of the Spirit's prayer;
 3  May He gain in every tribulation,
 3  Until we Christ's glory fully share.
 
 4  How could God from all His dealings spare us,
 4  After He spared not His only Son?
 4  Could the Potter's hand upon the vessel
 4  Ever leave the shaping work undone?
 4  For the center of God's heart's desire
 4  Is that many brethren we will be
 4  Unto Christ, His precious First-begotten,
 4  And to Him, conformed we'll fully be.
 
 5  Heirs of God! Joint-heirs with our Lord Jesus!
 5  What a hope of glory this for us!
 5  Though the suff'rings presently seem grievous,
 5  Greater far the glory then for us!
 5  Yea, in all these things we more than conquer,
 5  Through the One whose love has us possessed;
 5  Soon the day for which waits all creation,
 5  When the sons of God are manifest!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 
 1  Given us, given us, God has given us
 1  Precious faith, power divine, greatest promises.
 1  We believed, we received, now we have all three;
 1  By these we may grow unto maturity.
 
 2  Precious faith in each saint, precious equally,
 2  Precious faith holding us, holding ceaselessly.
 2  Disagree or agree, still it holds us fast,
 2  Day by day, eternally this faith shall last.
 
 3  Power divine wrought in us is the source so great;
 3  Power divine is in us now to operate.
 3  Hence will spring everything for our life within
 3  And for godliness without, expressing Him.
 
 4  Promises, promises, all God's called ones share;
 4  Promises, given us, great and precious are.
 4  These we take to partake of God's nature true,
 4  Having thus escaped the world's corruption too.
 
 5  Christ within, as the pow'r, in our spirit lives;
 5  Christ without is the Word - all God's promises.
 5  Now the key is that we daily contact both,
 5  Calling, praying, reading to produce the growth.
 
 6  Faith and pow'r, promises - these our full supply.
 6  Diligence, diligence, let us now apply;
 6  For if we, to these three, full attention show
 6  From the seed of faith the fruit of love will grow.
 
 7  In the growth from the seed many items come;
 7  By this growth in the Lord fruitful we become.
 7  For this we need to see what the Lord's begun,
 7  Ne'er forgetful be nor blind to what He's done.
 
 8  Diligence day by day will this growth insure;
 8  Diligence thus will make our election sure.
 8  When indeed with this seed we cooperate,
 8  We're supplied the kingdom's entrance, rich and great.
 
 9  For this growth, for this growth, Lord, ourselves we give,
 9  By the faith, promises, and the pow'r to live.
 9  Nothing more, nothing less, will our basis be
 9  By Thy grace we will cooperate with Thee.

 1  The Lord of all has shown His plan
 1     Unto each faithful one,
 1  Who leaves behind the worldly things
 1     As virgins for His Son.
 1  To be His Bride we must match Him,
 1     Within and outwardly;
 1  To be this one who matches Him,
 1     Enjoy Him constantly.
 
 2  Like virgins who so single are,
 2     They love the Groom so much,
 2  They in His presence ever stay -
 2     Lord Jesus, make us such.
 2  Lord, make us those who are so wise,
 2     Who gain You every day,
 2  The wise ones who enjoy the feast,
 2     Who all the price will pay.
 
 3  The virgins are mature in life,
 3     They grow so normally.
 3  They daily eat and drink the Lord,
 3     Their lot eternally.
 3  Our need today is growth in life,
 3     Christ's inward work indeed;
 3  Not knowledge, teachings, gifts, nor pow'r -
 3     But life is all we need.
 
 4  Lord, as the seed of life within,
 4     Grow more in us each day;
 4  By spreading from our deepest part,
 4     Gain us in every way.
 4  Lord, strengthen Thou our inner man;
 4     Make home in all our heart.
 4  Fill us completely with Thyself
 4     In every inward part.

 2  Christ is our inner life; He's in our spirit now;
 2  Not far away from us - He's right inside!

 4  The real experience of Christ in daily life,

 4  Not empty forms and such, but Christ will be so much;
 4  And we will see Him here as the meeting life.
 
 5  Without the inner life there is no daily life,
 5  There is no meeting life, there is no church!
 5  Christ as our inner life, Christ in our daily life
 5  Will make the meeting life new and glorious!

 1  What a wonderful change in my living is wrought
 1     By saying Amen to God's Word.
 1  More of Christ into me at each instance is brought

   By saying Amen to His Word,

Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,

   By saying Amen to His Word,
   By saying Amen to His Word,
Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,
   By saying Amen to His Word.

   By saying Amen to His Word,
   By saying Amen to His Word,
Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,
   By saying Amen to His Word.
 
 4  Now the secret of faith in the Lord I can see -
 4     It's saying Amen to His Word.
 4  He is more real and precious than all things to me
 4     By saying Amen to His Word.
 
   By saying Amen to His Word,
   By saying Amen to His Word,
Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,
   By saying Amen to His Word.
 
 5  Now my love for the brothers abounds more and more
 5     By saying Amen to God's Word.
 5  And I'm being related as never before
 5     By saying Amen to His Word.
 
   By saying Amen to His Word,
   By saying Amen to His Word,
Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,

   Lord Jesus, Amen to Your Word,
You are coming again - all my heart says Amen!
   Lord Jesus, Amen to Your Word.

 1  Remove the veils, Lord, from my heart;
 1  True revelation grant to me;
 1  A vision clear, O Lord, impart
 1        Of Thy recovery.
 
 2  By revelation I perceive
 2  The power that raised Christ from the dead;
 2  When I by faith this power receive,
 2        I to the church am led.
 
 3  Thy mighty power has set me free
 3  From all the world's distracting things;
 3  An entrance to the local church
 3        This mighty power brings.
 
 4  Once in the local church, I need
 4  To take Thee as my person, Lord;
 4  My outward man each day recede,
 4        My heart is for the Lord.
 
 5  I take Thee as my person, Lord;
 5  I have been crucified with Thee.
 5  My inner man has been restored;
 5        I'm now indwelt by Thee.
 
 6  When all Thy members self forsake,
 6  Thy glorious Body, Lord, is known;
 6  When of Thy Person we partake,
 6        The one new man is shown.
 
 7  The church life is the one new man
 7  In every local church expressed;
 7  Thy Body is a corporate man,
 7        One Person manifest.

 1  Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd
 1     Brought us right out of the fold
 1  Into His pasture so plenteous,
 1     Into His riches untold.
 
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we're dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.
 
 2  In the divisions He sought us,
 2     Weary and famished for food;
 2  Into the good land He brought us,
 2     Oh, to our spirit how good!
 
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we're dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.
 
 3  Jesus Himself is our pasture,
 3     He is the food that we eat;
 3  We as His sheep are fed richly
 3     Each time, whenever we meet.
 
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we're dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.
 
 4  Dwell we here on a high mountain,
 4     Wet with the morning-fresh dew,
 4  Slaking our thirst at the fountain,
 4     Water so living and new.
 
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we're dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.
 
 5  Christ is our rest and enjoyment,
 5     Here we have nothing to fear;
 5  Here all the sheep dwell securely,
 5     Kept by His presence so dear.
 
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we're dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.

 1  Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of all,
 1  Now He is dwelling in Jerusalem.
 1  Tell among us all His doings great and small,
 1  His throne, the heavens, yet He walks with men.
 1  Oh, the salvation out of Zion comes;
 1  He brought us back from our captivity.
 1  Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad;
 1  Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad!
 
 2  In the Holy City with His own He dwells;
 2  O Lord, our Lord how excellent Thy name!
 2  He's enthroned upon the praises of His saints;
 2  All His delight in Zion does remain.
 2  The local churches are His move today -
 2  He is our portion, we are satisfied.
 2  Oh, what a goodly heritage have we;
 2  Oh, what a goodly heritage have we!
 
 3  Who shall in His holy tabernacle dwell,
 3  Who shall ascend to His most holy hill?
 3  Those who seek for Him and purify their heart;
 3  This generation now that seeks His face.
 3  Oh, seek His face, ye children of the earth,
 3  Open your heart, and let the King come in.
 3  He will come in, and He shall live and reign;
 3  He will come in, and He shall live and reign!
 
 4  Look! God's tabernacle now is with the saints;
 4  Emmanuel - God with us, we proclaim.
 4  Everything is done, so let His children come;
 4  Christ and the church - where God and man are one!
 4  Lift up your heads, ye cities of the earth;
 4  Open your gates, and let the King come in.
 4  Shout to His praise - He's coming in to reign!
 4  Shout to His praise - He's coming in to reign!

 1  We from the law to Christ have turned;
 1  To trust in Him by grace we've learned.
 1  And since His glory we've discerned
 1     We only care for Christ!
 
We only care for Christ!
We only care for Christ!
And since His glory we've discerned
We only care for Christ!
 
 2  Christ brings us to God's house to dwell,

How lovely is God's house!
How lovely is God's house!
O hallelujah! None can tell

On Zion's holy hill,
On Zion's holy hill,
The place for God to rule is this
On Zion's holy hill.

 4  All nations will proclaim His worth,

Break forth and sing for joy,
Break forth and sing for joy,
All nations will proclaim His worth,
Break forth and sing for joy.
 
 5  Christ - house - the city - earth, we see;
 5  Thus God's great plan fulfilled will be.
 5  O brothers, let us utterly

Be one with Him for this,
Be one with Him for this,
O brothers, let us utterly
Be one with Him for this.

 1  Lord, to know Thee as the Body,
 1  Is my desperate need today,
 1  Oh, to see Thee in Thy members,
 1  'Tis for this I long and pray.
 1  No more just to know Thy headship,
 1  In an individual way,
 1  But to see Thee incarnated,
 1  As the Body-Christ, I pray.
 
 2  Through the years, Thy saints have sought Thee,
 2  Longing for reality;
 2  Gazing upward, searching inward,
 2  Thirsting for the sight of Thee.
 2  Now reveal that Christ in heaven,
 2  Is the Body manifest;
 2  And the Christ who dwells within us
 2  As the Body is expressed.
 
 3  Prone to be misled, I know it,
 3  By my lofty thoughts of Thee,
 3  Easy 'tis for self to seek Thee,
 3  Yet not touch reality,
 3  Oh, how much I need to find Thee,
 3  In Thy members here below.
 3  God eternal dwells among us,
 3  Manifest in flesh to know.
 
 4  Limit, Lord, my independence,
 4  Let me to Thy Body turn;
 4  Not just seeking light from heaven,
 4  But the church's sense to learn.
 4  May we be the stones for building,
 4  Not the formless, useless clay,
 4  Gain in us Thy heart's desire,
 4  Corporately Thyself display.

 1  Oh, the church of Christ is glorious, and we are part of it -
 1     We're so happy that the Lord has made us one!
 1  There's a Body in the universe and we belong to it -
 1     Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!
 
Hallelujah for the Body!
We are members of the Body!
We are wholly for the Body!
Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!
 
 2  Not the individual Christians, but a corporate entity -
 2     God must have it for His full expression now;
 2  Not just individual churches but the Body corporately -
 2     Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!
 
Hallelujah for the Body!
Satan trembles at the Body!
We're victorious in the Body!
Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!
 
 3  There are seven golden lampstands in the nature all divine -
 3     Nothing natural does the Body life allow.
 3  When we're one and share God's nature, how the lampstand then does shine -
 3     Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!
 
Hallelujah for the Body!
For the lampstands of the Body!
For the golden, shining Body!
Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!
 
 4  How may we express such oneness, be divine and shining too?
 4     Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!
 4  He's the tree of life, the manna, and the feast that's ever new -
 4     Hallelujah, we may eat Him every day!
 
We are one by eating Jesus!
We're divine by eating Jesus!
How we shine by eating Jesus!
Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!

 1  Our Lord, that One of peerless worth
 1  Came first to die to give new birth;

Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
Jesus! May our hearts make room

 2  What our dear Lord desires the most,
 2  Is not to just redeem the lost;
 2  But that some saints would pay the cost,
 2     To be His Bride forever.
 
Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
Jesus! May our hearts make room
To be Your Bride forever.
 
 3  As virgins we must single be,
 3  No other husband could have we,
 3  That when He comes we'll then be free

Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
Jesus! May our hearts make room
To be Your Bride forever.
 
 4  How could we love this fading world,

 4  To Him we must our love unfurl

 1  The Bible is the Word of God,
 1     Its message is but one -
 1  Christ and the church, His holy Bride,
 1     The two becoming one.
 
Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
   Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
   And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.
 
 2  The Father is the mighty God,
 2     His purpose is but one -
 2  To find a Bride for Christ the Lord
 2     And give her to His Son.
 
Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
   Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
   And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.
 
 3  The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,
 3     His heart desire's but one -
 3  To have a loving counterpart,
 3     A Bride He's wooed and won.
 
Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
   Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
   And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.
 
 4  The Spirit is but Christ Himself,
 4     He is the Lord applied
 4  To generate the men of earth,
 4     Transform them as His Bride.
 
Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
   Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
   And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.
 
 5  The living Word is Jesus too,
 5     God-breathed as life to us,
 5  That we be wholly sanctified,

Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
   Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
   And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.

 1  The church is Christ's deep longing
 1  And His good pleasure too.
 1  His every word and action
 1  Is made with her in view.
 1  His heart's love is established,
 1  And nought can Him deter;
 1  Before the earth's foundation
 1  His thoughts were filled with her.
 
 2  The eve of all creation
 2  He mused on His delight,
 2  And pondered every feature,
 2  Well-pleasing in His sight.
 2  Creation sprang to being,
 2  But deep in Him did hide
 2  A heart of depth unfathomed
 2  Fixed on a glorious Bride.
 
 3  And thus His will was 'stablished
 3  His counterpart to gain:
 3  This blessed, firm intention,
 3  Eternally the same.
 3  Though sin should e'en beguile man,
 3  Then mock his helpless state,
 3  He never could forsake her,
 3  His yearning ne'er abate.
 
 4  Then mercy richly flourished,
 4  And love was, oh, so vast,
 4  As graciously He sought her
 4  With wisdom unsurpassed.
 4  The love He gave to win her
 4  God only comprehends!
 4  His life laid down, an offering
 4  Whose fragrance yet ascends.
 
 5  And now in resurrection
 5  To her He draws most near,
 5  And with untold affection
 5  In glory does appear.
 5  As she beholds her Bridegroom,
 5  His glory floods her heart,
 5  'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,
 5  His longed-for counterpart.

 1  One new man is the Father's plan;
 1  He redeemed us from the sons of men.
 1  Every kindred, tribe and tongue,
 1  In Himself He called us to be one.
 1  God's expression on the earth
 1  Now reveals His glorious worth.
 1  One new man is the Father's plan;
 1  He redeemed us from the sons of men.
 
 2  On the cross ordinances slain,
 2  That He might form just one of twain.
 2  Reconciling us to God,
 2  Thus on the serpent's head He trod.
 2  He breaks down the middle wall
 2  As upon His name we call;
 2  On the cross ordinances slain,
 2  That He might form just one of twain.
 
 3  For this cause Your Person, Lord,
 3  We take and stand in one accord;
 3  All the members self forsake,
 3  And of the Body-Christ partake.
 3  We in Christ as one new man
 3  Now come forth to take this land.
 3  For this cause Your Person, Lord,
 3  We take and stand in one accord.

 1  Once by nature we were dead in sin,
 1  In a world of utter discord;
 1  But together God has quickened us,
 1  Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.
 
 2  Thus with all saints we can apprehend,
 2  All the vast dimensions of God.
 2  Knowing Christ's love passes all we know.
 2  We're together filled to fullness with our God.
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.
 
 3  Now we know the purpose of our God,
 3  Visible the mystery became:
 3  Christ, the church, together now we see,
 3  And together put the enemy to shame.
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.
 
 4  For this cause we pray the Father God -
 4  Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
 4  Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
 4  Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.
 
 5  In the Body we'll be fitly framed
 5  As the many members Christ supply;
 5  Working in the measure of each part,
 5  All by growth in love the Body edify.
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.
 
 6  Now we're one His purpose to fulfill,
 6  As the one new man of His plan.
 6  Unto Him be glory in the church,
 6  And in Jesus Christ forevermore - Amen!
 
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

 1     O home in the church,
 1     Where we've ended our search
 1  With the brothers rejoicing all day;
 1     Where Christ is our life,
 1     And we're through with all strife,
 1  Now we're home, hallelujah, to stay!
 
Home, home in the church;
Yes, it's here that we've ended our search;
   And through all our days
   We will shout to His praise,
"Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"
 
 2     Here God is at rest,

 2     His home is our heart,

 2  Here His glory He'll fully display.
 
God's home is the church;
Yes, it's here that He ended His search;
   And through all our days
   We will shout to His praise,
"Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"

 1  I thirsted in the barren land of Babylon
 1     And nothing satisfying there I found;
 1  But to the blessed local church one day I came,
 1     Where springs of living water do abound.
 
Drinking at the springs of living water,
   Happy now am I,
   My heart they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
O wonderful and bountiful supply!
 
 2  How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
 2     It's flowing in and flowing out of me;
 2  O now I've found the place for which I long had sought,
 2     Where there is life and life abundantly.
 
Drinking at the springs of living water,
   Happy now am I,
   My heart they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
O wonderful and bountiful supply!
 
 3  O brother, won't you gather in the local church?
 3     A fountain here is flowing deep and wide.
 3  The Shepherd now would bring you to the local church,
 3     Where thirsty spirits can be satisfied.
 
Drinking at the springs of living water,
   Happy now am I,
   My heart they satisfy;
Drinking at the springs of living water,
O wonderful and bountiful supply!

 1  Oh, listen to the wanderer
 1  In whom there was a lack;
 1  Then hearken to the song he sings
 1  And follow in his track.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 2  A wanderer within the world
 2  For pleasure ever seeks;
 2  Be it in body or in mind,
 2  With vanity it reeks.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 3  For self I labored day and night,
 3  My castles built in sand;
 3  But, praise the Lord, He wrecked them all -
 3  Much better things He planned.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 4  Once all for self - confused, alone,
 4  How could I bear the shame?
 4  But now within the local church
 4  I'll never be the same.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 5  I am a happy member now
 5  Within the local church.
 5  A wanderer has found his home
 5  And ended all his search.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 6  I was an individualist,
 6  An island in myself;
 6  But now the Lord is building me
 6  With others in Himself
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 7  I'm drawn together with His own
 7  In fellowship so sweet.
 7  I've learned from others to receive
 7  Of Christ whene'er we meet.
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!
 
 8  My wanderings have really ceased -
 8  I've found the church, God's best!
 8  The secret of my happiness -
 8  Enjoying God's own rest!
 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
I'll never be the same!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  In the church the sound of life upon our ear is falling,
 1  Then we see the joy of Christ expressed on every hand;
 1  Babylon and things of earth in vain to us are calling.
 1     We are home forever in Christ our land.
 
We're churching in the Spirit
On the church's local ground;
We're churching with our brothers,
Our family we have found.
Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
   With hallelujahs for Christ our land!
 
 2  Far away our background seems with all its gifts and teaching,
 2  Farther still, the worldly things with all their foul demand;
 2  As the love of Jesus Christ our inmost heart is reaching,
 2     Not a thing can move us from Christ our land.
 
We're churching in the Spirit
On the church's local ground;
We're churching with our brothers,
Our family we have found.
Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
   With hallelujahs for Christ our land!
 
 3  "I will build My church upon this rock," said the Lord Jesus,
 3  And we see the building of His purpose and His plan;
 3  Setting members in the Body as Himself it pleases,
 3     Building us together in Christ our land.
 
We're churching in the Spirit
On the church's local ground;
We're churching with our brothers,
Our family we have found.
Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
   With hallelujahs for Christ our land!
 
 4  Now the Lord's recovery is everywhere proceeding,
 4  All the churches join in one to give the Lord command:
 4  "Speed the day when all the earth will echo with pray-reading
 4     And with hallelujahs for Christ our land."
 
We're churching in the Spirit
On the church's local ground;
We're churching with our brothers,
Our family we have found.
Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
   With hallelujahs for Christ our land!

 1  Splendid church life! His green garden!
 1     He has brought us, praise the Lord!
 1  To experience the Christ Who's growing here!
 1     He is full of rich enjoyment to His saints in one accord;
 1  He is new and fresh, available and dear!
 
I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.
 
 2  It is not a school or factory or a chapel in the air;
 2     But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.
 2  So He's placed us all here corporately to be His garden fair,
 2     Where He's free to cultivate and make us grow.
 
I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.
 
 3  Thus within the church-life garden there's a fruit-producing tree
 3     Full of life and so available to eat.
 3  So be simple, don't be hardened, drop your concepts - eat that tree!
 3     Take in Jesus every moment - He's so sweet!
 
I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.
 
 4  With the tree there is the water, flowing God in Christ to us,
 4     Quenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.
 4  Hallelujah! In His garden Jesus flows Himself to us,
 4     As the full supply for us to grow in life.
 
I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.
 
 5  Aren't you satisfied and thankful that our Lord has brought you in
 5     Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
 5  So be happy and be joyful, in the spirit feast on Him,
 5     So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.
 
I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  Never did I dream before,
 1  Such a place could e'er be found,
 1  Where the tears of sorrow cease,
 1  Songs of endless joy abound.
 1  One who seldom ever sang,
 1  Now delights his voice to raise;
 1  Singing hymns with all the saints,
 1  Echoing the ceaseless praise.
 
 2  Day by day the world goes on,
 2  Just as it has gone before.
 2  Millions grasp and clutch at life,
 2  Wond'ring if there could be more;
 2  Such was I and would be, yet
 2  Mercy found me out somehow;
 2  With what gratefulness I say,
 2  "I'm in God's own family now."
 
 3  How delightful 'tis to know;
 3  How subjective, real, and sweet
 3  Is this inward joy of grace
 3  We experience when we meet;
 3  Life abundant Jesus gives
 3  As my full reality;
 3  Praise You, Lord, it's really true,
 3  I'm in Your own family.
 
 4  At the closing of this age,
 4  Just before Your kingdom's dawn,
 4  May You gain a people, Lord,
 4  For Your dwelling place, Your home.
 4  Since for me You gave Your all,
 4  Everything I lay aside;
 4  For Your church my all I'd give,
 4  That You would be satisfied.

 1  Deeper, deeper, in the cross of Jesus;
 1     Deeper let me go;
 1  Death and life, they always go together;
 1     Deepen, Lord, the flow.
 1  Oh, deeper yet we pray,
 1     Do work in us each day;
 1  Go deeper, through and through,
 1     Till in Thee we're wholly new.
 
 2  Higher, higher, in the life of Jesus;
 2     Lord, we are so low.
 2  By Thy life we all can go much higher -
 2     Higher let us go.
 2  Oh, higher yet we pray - Transform us every day -
 2     And richer in the flow;
 2  May Thy life be all we know.
 
 3  Growing, growing, in us He is growing,
 3     More and more each day.
 3  Into all our living He is flowing -
 3     This is now His way.
 3  For growth, O Lord, we pray;
 3     Increase in us each day.
 3  It's not enough to know;
 3     Now Thy life in us must grow.
 
 4  Living, living, Christ is all our living,
 4     He's so practical:
 4  Small things, big things, anything and all things -
 4     He's involved in all.
 4  Live Christ in every way;
 4     Oh, live Him out today.
 4  His name you now must call,
 4     And give Him your all for all.
 
 5  Person, Person, Jesus is our Person,
 5     Living now in us.
 5  He's our tastes, our attitudes and actions;
 5     Oh, how glorious!
 5  Our Person, Lord, Thou art;
 5     Make home in all our heart.
 5  As life in every way
 5     Be our Person, Lord, each day.
 
 6  Churches, churches, in the local churches
 6     We all find the flow:
 6  Deeper, higher, Christ as all our living,
 6     For the church we grow.
 6  The churches are today
 6     Just Christ in every way.
 6  For this, from self we cease,
 6     For Thy Body, Thine increase.
 
 7  Building, building, we will see the building
 7     Of the church this way:
 7  Christ experienced will produce the building -
 7     He's the only way.
 7  Oh, build us, Lord, we pray,
 7     By growth of life each day.
 7  Oh, make us now such men
 7     For the new Jerusalem.
 
 8  Coming, coming, Jesus soon is coming
 8     For His chosen Bride.
 8  In the churches we are all preparing
 8     To be glorified.
 8  Lord Jesus, come again -
 8     This cry is deep within.
 8  We'll praise Thee to the end,
 8     Oh, come back! Come back! Amen!

 1  God's life and building can be seen
 1     Within the Song of Songs;
 1  He shows by types His seeking ones,
 1     The Bride for whom Christ longs!
 
 2  She, as a team of horses shows
 2     A love, so swift and strong!
 2  But this is love that's natural -
 2     It pulls the world along!
 
 3  As time goes by, her concepts change,
 3     With dove's eyes she can see
 3  That naught can with her love compare -
 3     There's none so dear as He!
 
 4  A lily she is now to Him
 4     (For still the Lord draws on),
 4  Her faith is not in earthly toil,
 4     But in the wondrous Son.
 
 5  She's next a dove who hides herself
 5     Within a cloven rock;
 5  Now in her Lord's ascended life
 5     Is love which knows no shock!
 
 6  Of smoke, a pillar she's become,
 6     And now, as wand'ring ends,
 6  Her wills to His will are subdued,
 6     What fragrance sweet ascends!
 
 7  Behold His couch... (O, can this be?)
 7     E'en midst the fearsome night...
 7  She now affords her Lord such rest,
 7     The foe is put to flight!
 
 8  A vessel to contain the King!
 8     (This type is full of worth.)
 8  A palanquin He's made Himself
 8     For His move on the earth!
 
 9  Of wood this vessel is composed:
 9     Christ's ris'n humanity.
 9  Its silver pillars for support
 9     And floor of gold we see!
 
 10  The seat of purple signifies
 10     Christ is of kings the King.
 10  To Him, as fittings for within,
 10     Their love His dear ones bring!
 
 11  The day will come - ('tis surely soon)
 11     And glad will be Thy heart -
 11  What boast and glory to Thyself;
 11     Thy crown, Thy counterpart!
 
 12  A garden fair, enclosed is she
 12     With spices, fragrant, sweet.
 12  She now brings forth materials
 12     The building to complete!
 
 13  A city pleasant, comely, too;
 13     No greater building, this!
 13  So beautiful, yet to the foe
 13     A conq'ring army 'tis!
 
 14  As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord,
 14     The transformation's done,
 14  Until at last, the work's complete -
 14     Christ and His Bride are one!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 
 
 1  The Lord, the seed of life, has sown Himself into our heart
 1  To grow up into fullness and become His counterpart.
 1  The seed requires no rules or forms, for water is its need -
 1  By this the all-inclusive seed will grow in us indeed!
 
The seed is simply Jesus! Oh, Jesus lives in me!
And by His growth this seed in us will reach maturity.
 
 2  The growth of Christ, the seed, in us will soon produce the wheat,
 2  The life within break forth - yet work divine is not complete;
 2  For wheat alone can never be the seed's expression true;
 2  So all the grains must blend together into something new.
 
The seed is simply Jesus; now wheat is Jesus too!
The grains of wheat must blend together into something new.
 
 3  The individual grains of wheat no longer must be free,
 3  But crushed together, ground to powder, every grain must be,
 3  Until the wheat becomes the meal from which the loaf is formed
 3  Till all the saints will blend and to His Body be conformed.
 
We all must take the grinding until the Christ within
Can mold into His Body all the individual grains.
 
 4  The seed is planted, wheat is grown and meal is the sum
 4  Of all the growth upon God's farm, where Christians grow as one;
 4  But all the growth in life is for the building of the church,
 4  That God and man may have a home and both may end their search.
 
The farm is for the building, for God and man a home,
Where both may dwell among His people gathered into one.
 
 5  God's building is produced by silver, precious stones, and gold -
 5  From meal through transformation, pressure, heat, and pain untold.
 5  The meal must not be satisfied to stay as meal alone,
 5  But must submit to transformation into precious stone.
 
The meal must pass through suffering that precious stones be formed;
Then built into God's building, to His purpose full conformed.
 
 6  From fullest growth and transformation comes a pearl of worth;
 6  This simple, precious, all-inclusive gem will then come forth.
 6  Conceived in death and formed in life by that all-glorious One,
 6  The church, His Bride, the fruit of all the work that He has done.
 
The pearl is what He's after, the Bride to please His heart,
So single, pure and precious, and His very counterpart.
 
 7  The growth in life begins when planted on God's farm we're found;
 7  The growing seed becomes the wheat from which the meal is ground.
 7  But building work proceeds when meal submits to be transformed;
 7  Then gold and silver, precious stones for building will be formed.
 
The farm is for the building, built up by precious stones,
From which the priceless pearl comes forth to be His Bride, His own.
 
 8  Lord, keep us poor in spirit, pure in heart that we may be
 8  Good ground in which the seed of life may grow abundantly,
 8  Until the final stage is reached and You are satisfied
 8  And have Your priceless, chosen pearl, Your joy complete, Your Bride.
 
Lord, keep us poor in spirit and purified in heart,
That growing up in us You may bring forth Your counterpart.

 1  We are one in the spirit, by His life we are one,
 1  We have left all divisions, Body-life has begun,
 1  For the Lord broke all barriers, proclaiming, "It is done."
 
Brothers:
In the church we are brothers,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
 
Sisters:
In the church we are sisters,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
   (Praise the Lord!)
 
Everyone:
And we praise Him that our unity
   has now been restored.
 
 2  We are one in the spirit, yet it goes deeper still,
 2  For this oneness is spreading to our mind, emotion, will,
 2  As we all stand together that His purpose He fulfill.
 
Brothers:
In the church we are brothers,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
 
Sisters:
In the church we are sisters,

 3  We are one in the spirit, we are one actually,
 3  Not in talk nor in theory, but in fact, practically,
 3  In the churches we're all enjoying this reality.
 
Brothers:
In the church we are brothers,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
 
Sisters:
In the church we are sisters,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
   (Praise the Lord!)
 
Everyone:
And we praise Him that our unity

 4  We are one in the spirit in each locality,
 4  For the Lord's own intention we would consecrated be,
 4  That the oneness He's given us the whole world may see.
 
Brothers:
In the church we are brothers,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
 
Sisters:
In the church we are sisters,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

 1  Behold how good a thing
 1  It is to dwell in peace;
 1  How pleasing to our King,
 1  This fruit of righteousness;
 1  When brethren all in one agree,
 1  They know the joy of unity!
 
 2  When all are sweetly joined
 2  (True followers of the Lamb),
 2  They're one in heart and mind,
 2  They think and speak the same;
 2  When all in love together dwell;
 2  The comfort is unspeakable!
 
 3  Where unity takes place,
 3  The joys of heav'n we prove;
 3  This is the gospel grace,
 3  The unction from above;
 3  The Spirit on all saints is shed,
 3  Descending swift from Christ the Head.
 
 4  Where unity is found,
 4  The sweet anointing grace
 4  Extends to all around,
 4  And shines from every face;
 4  To every praising saint it comes,
 4  And fills him with divine perfumes.
 
 5  On all His chosen ones
 5  The precious oil comes down:
 5  Anointing as it runs,
 5  Anointing on and on.
 5  E'en to His skirts (the meanest name
 5  That longs to love the bleeding Lamb).
 
 6  From Aaron's beard it rolls,
 6  (Those nearest to His face),
 6  The humble, trembling souls
 6  Who know abundant grace;
 6  The grace, the grace for all is free,
 6  For, lo, it reaches now to me!

 1  When the brothers are in order,
 1  And you sense Christ is their life,
 1  Follow them and watch for Jesus,
 1  Ending thus your thought and strife.
 
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.
 
 2  When you follow, as you follow,
 2  Take the blood, and call His name;

 2  And the enemy you'll shame.
 
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.
 
 3  When they speak, as they are speaking,
 3  Open wide your heart to them,
 3  Thus the Word of God receiving,
 3  Word of God, and not of men.
 
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.
 
 4  Now the Word of God is running,
 4  Running fast, and running free.
 4  This is how the Lord is moving,
 4  In His own recovery.
 
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.
 
 5  O be glad, rejoice, dear brothers,
 5  For the coming wedding day.
 5  Then the Bride will be made ready -
 5  Those who followed all the way.
 
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
Help prepare the Bride for Christ.

 1  We give ourselves to follow the churches,
 1     Oneness in Christ display;
 1  Follow His move in all of the churches,
 1     Stand fast as one this way.
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!
 
 2  We give ourselves to follow the followers,
 2     By this we truly learn;
 2  Never desiring to be the leaders,
 2     But to the Spirit turn.
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!
 
 3  We give ourselves the flock's steps to follow,
 3     Knowing the Shepherd's care.
 3  Now in the churches Jesus is leading
 3     And He is speaking there.
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!
 
 4  We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,
 4     Never to turn aside;
 4  Where'er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,
 4     Follow whate'er betide.
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!
 
 5  We give ourselves to enter the kingdom,
 5     That marriage feast, with Him;
 5  Come persecution, suffering, and trials,
 5     Still we will enter in.
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!
 
 6  Christ wants some followers here in the churches,
 6     Followers of whom to say:
 6  "These saw My purpose, followed Me wholly" -
 6     May we be those today!
 
We must follow the Spirit
   In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus -
   He follows perfectly!

 1  Recall how David swore,
 1  "I'll not come into my house,
 1  Nor go up to my bed,
 1  Give slumber to mine eyelids,
 1  Until I find a place for Thee,
 1  A place, O Lord, for Thee."
 1  Our mighty God desires a home
 1  Where all His own may come.
 
 2  How blinded we have been,
 2  Shut in with what concerns us;
 2  While God's house lieth waste -
 2  Lord, break through, overturn us;
 2  We'll go up to the mountain,
 2  Bring wood and build the house;
 2  We'll never say, "Another day!"
 2  It's time! We'll come and build!
 
 3  O Lord, against these days,
 3  Inspire some for Your building,
 3  Just as in David's day -
 3  A remnant who are willing
 3  To come and work in Your house,
 3  Oh, what a blessed charge!
 3  Your heart's desire, is our desire -
 3  We come, O Lord, to build.
 
 4  Within those whom You'd call
 4  Put such a restless caring
 4  For building to give all -
 4  These times are for preparing;
 4  The gates of hell cannot prevail
 4  Against the builded Church!
 4  The hours are few, the builders too -
 4  Lord, build, O build in us!

 1  How oft believers through the years
 1  Have sought the will of Jesus,
 1  And would have offered everything
 1  To walk as Him it pleases.
 1  If you should seek the will of God,
 1  Don't waste another minute;
 1  The church life is His glorious will,
 1  And you too must get in it.
 
 2  "What is the will of God for me?"
 2  How oft you've asked this question.
 2  It is the church life, corporately,
 2  Where God finds His expression.
 2  Don't watch the church life from afar,
 2  Or erringly construe it;
 2  Come gaze upon it from within -
 2  You'll give your whole life to it.
 
 3  The church life here is realized,
 3  'Tis all the Lord intended;
 3  And in this rich experience
 3  All further seeking's ended.
 3  The church life is His glorious will -
 3  Now for yourself begin it.
 3  The surest way to know His will
 3  Is simply to get in it.
 
 4  So let us give our all for this,
 4  And hold ourselves not dearly;
 4  The church life is the will of God,
 4  Let's take our standing clearly.
 4  Oh, we have found the will of God;
 4  Christ died and rose to win it.
 4  The church life is His glorious will,
 4  And, praise the Lord, we're in it!

 1  O surely I will not come in
 1     Within my house to stay,
 1  Nor yet give sleep unto my eyes,
 1     Till Jesus has His way.
 1  Upon the earth, the Lord desires
 1     A place where He may live;
 1  For this, Thy habitation, Lord,
 1     Myself I fully give.
 
 2  We heard of it while yet far off,
 2     We found it in the way;
 2  We then came up into her courts,
 2     And here we'll ever stay.
 2  Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest,
 2     Thou and Thy ark so strong.
 2  Thy priests are clothed with righteousness;
 2     Thy saints with joy and song.
 
 3  The Lord has sworn in truth to us,
 3     He will not turn away -
 3  His Seed shall sit with Him enthroned,
 3     And reign with Him for aye.
 3  The Lord hath found a place to dwell,
 3     Hath chosen Zion fair;
 3  His habitation it will be,
 3     It is His rest fore'er.
 
 4  Her food abundant He will bless,
 4     Her needy, satisfy;
 4  And with salvation clothe her priests,
 4     And all her want supply.
 4  The horn of David's budding here,
 4     A lamp for earth's dark night.
 4  His enemies are clothed with shame,
 4     His saints with crowns of light.
 
 5  And now within these latter days,
 5     Amidst earth's dark unrest,
 5  God's house is being built again
 5     And all His people blessed.
 5  Secure within the local church,
 5     With saints in one accord
 5  We meet to just release our praise,
 5     And thus enjoy the Lord.

 4  For the church be absolute,
 4  All that's otherwise uproot
 4     In the local churches now.
 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are all in one accord
For the building of the Lord,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are living in the local churches now!
 
 5  The foundation now is laid -
 5  O what glory doth pervade!
 5  We are all with joy arrayed,
 5     O glory be to God!
 5  Let us raise a mighty shout -
 5  They will hear us far without,
 5  And the enemy we'll rout
 5     In the local churches now.
 
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are all in one accord
For the building of the Lord,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are living in the local churches now!

 1  Lord, Thy word of old to David
 1  We have heard and hear it now:
 1  "On Thy throne will sit forever
 1  Thine own seed - this is My vow."
 1  This has been fulfilled in Jesus
 1  Seated on the throne on high,
 1  Sitting on the throne of David
 1  Resurrected, ne'er to die.
 
 2  Then another promise followed
 2  David's seed upon the throne:
 2  "I'll rebuild His tabernacle
 2  And by this I will be known."
 2  Lord, we thank Thee, Thou art faithful
 2  To perform Thy promised word.
 2  David's tabernacle, ruined,
 2  Soon by Thee will be restored.
 
 3  Lord, we are that tabernacle,
 3  Thy rebuilding work on earth;
 3  Lord, restore Thyself a dwelling
 3  Where is seen Thy boundless worth.
 3  Thus shall all of mankind seek Thee,
 3  And the Gentiles call Thy name.
 3  From Thy holy tabernacle
 3  All the earth shall know Thy fame.
 
 4  Hasten, Lord, Thy work upon us
 4  To restore and build us now.
 4  For this work we give ourselves, Lord;

 1  This is the time for building the temple of the Lord
 1  That all the local churches may fully be restored.
 1  'Tis not the time for our house while God's house lieth waste -
 1  O brothers, for God's building, rise up, make haste!
 
Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.
 
 2  O hear, the Lord is speaking: Consider now your ways,
 2  Ye sow and bring in little, for lacking is My praise.
 2  Go up into the mountain, material to provide,
 2  And build My house that I may be glorified.
 
Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.
 
 3  Ye who are priests, ye remnant of Christians now obey -
 3  The Lord Himself is with us, whatever men may say,
 3  With spirits stirred and burning, now let us come to work;
 3  May none his part with others in building shirk.
 
Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.
 
 4  I'll fill this house with glory, the Lord of hosts has said,
 4  And the desire of nations will be exhibited.
 4  Its glory will be greater than all that's gone before,
 4  And we will share this glory forevermore.
 
Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.

Praise the Lord, we're in the Lord's recovery -
   Home at last, here in the church.
Praise the Lord, we're in the new creation -
   One new man, the end of our search.
With the saints, builded, coordinated;
   No more I, forever "we".
We are one in the Son, standing here till He comes;
Yes, nothing can stop our God till He's done!

 1  Do you see them in the cities,
 1     Meeting on the local ground?
 1  They're the local, golden lampstands,
 1     Where the Lord His home has found.
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 2  Do you see them in the meetings,
 2     Lifting up their voice on high,
 2  Every brother, sister sharing,
 2     Christ the Lord to magnify?
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 3  Do you hear them all pray-reading,
 3     Breathing in the living Word?
 3  Praying, praising, drinking, feeding,
 3     How they all enjoy the Lord!
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 4  Do you hear them call, "Lord Jesus"?
 4     How they love that blessed name!
 4  All the more their joy increases
 4     As His Lordship they proclaim.
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 5  Have you heard their hallelujahs,
 5     Like a mighty thunder blast?
 5  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 5     Down the enemy is cast!
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 6  Do you see the saints migrating?
 6     Praise the Lord the move is on
 6  For the church in every city
 6     That our blessed Lord may come!
 
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
   Where all the saints dwell as one!
 
 7  Do you see the Lord is coming
 7     For the church for whom He died?
 7  In the churches He's preparing
 7     Now His holy, chosen Bride.
 
'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
   Filled with the glory of the Lord!
'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
   Filled with the glory of the Lord!

 1  Oh, how lovable, how precious
 1  Are Thy local churches, Lord!
 1  My soul longeth, even fainteth
 1  For the courts of Thine abode;
 1  'Tis my heart's deep thirst and longing
 1  And my spirit deeply sighs;
 1  Fellowship among the churches -
 1  For this my whole being cries.
 
 2  Blessed is the man whose heart, to
 2  Zion, is an open way;
 2  He's the one whose strength is in Thee;
 2  He will praise Thee all the day.
 2  In communion with the churches,
 2  Trusting Thee, Thy praise he sings;
 2  Passing through the weeping valley,
 2  It becomes a place of springs.
 
 3  One day spent among Thy churches,
 3  Better than a thousand is!
 3  Even to the lowest member,
 3  Sun and shield Jehovah is.
 3  Grace and glory, every good thing,
 3  On us now He doth outpour;
 3  Blessed is that man who dwelleth
 3  In the churches evermore.

 1  See the local churches,
 1  'Midst the earth's dark night;
 1  Jesus' testimony,
 1  Bearing Him as light.
 1  Form by Him, unmeasured,
 1  In the Spirit's mold -
 1  All are one in nature.
 1  One pure work of gold.
 
See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
Shining forth with Christ.
 
 2  God in Christ, embodied,
 2  As God's lampstand, He
 2  Has become the Spirit,
 2  The reality.
 2  Spirit as the lampstand
 2  Has been multiplied;
 2  Many local churches,
 2  Now are realized!
 
See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
Shining forth with Christ.
 
 3  Caring for the churches
 3  Is the Son of Man:
 3  Voice of many waters,
 3  Stars in His right hand;
 3  Eyes aflame; His face is
 3  Shining as the sun;
 3  Churches - fear no trial,
 3  He's the living One!
 
See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
Shining forth with Christ.
 
 4  What can quench the lampstands?
 4  Who can them defy?
 4  More the opposition -
 4  More they multiply!
 4  Deeper darkness 'round them,
 4  Brighter do they shine.
 4  They are constituted
 4  With the life divine.
 
See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
Shining forth with Christ.
 
 5  Soon the local churches
 5  Shall the Bride become,
 5  Bringing in that city - New Jerusalem.
 5  Then the many lampstands
 5  Shall one lampstand be;
 5  Triune God expressing,
 5  Universally.
 
Lo, from heav'n descending,
All the earth shall see
God's complete expression,
For eternity.

 1  There's a church in New York City*,
 1  Standing on the local ground;
 1  There's a lampstand brightly beaming,
 1  Shining out to millions 'round.
 1  We were raised from every nation,
 1  Every people, tribe, and tongue -
 1  With us God has gained a dwelling,
 1  'Tis where all His own may come.
 
 2  In your midst, O New York City,
 2  Little do you realize -
 2  Fallen is a seed within you,
 2  'Midst corruption it shall rise;
 2  Rising up in resurrection,
 2  With an increase many fold,
 2  It shall blossom, manifesting
 2  Riches of God's life untold.
 
 3  For the church in New York City
 3  Faithfully the saints have prayed.
 3  'Gainst the church in New York City
 3  How the devil is enraged!
 3  For behold, within the center
 3  Of his kingdom, dark and grim,
 3  God has gained a testimony,
 3  Moving, fighting on for Him.
 
 4  There's a church in New York City
 4  Who the gospel does proclaim,
 4  To the hungry, poor, and weary,
 4  Sick, imprisoned, and the lame.
 4  Now this gospel of the kingdom
 4  Shall be preached until the end;
 4  Till the Lord who with the kingdom
 4  Of the heavens does descend.
 
 5  There's a church in New York City,
 5  Honoring the risen Christ;
 5  Caring for the other churches -
 5  Following in truth and light;
 5  With them in coordination,
 5  We the kingdom will possess;
 5  Fighting as one mighty army,
 5  Till the kingdom's manifest.

In the age of Revelation,
Out from all denomination,
We are in the local churches,
   In spirit one.
Nothing old or religious binds,
Everyone's a star that shines;
Every church a golden lampstand,
   Burning with Christ.
 
Christ and a burning church,
Christ and a burning church,
Christ and the church with the saints,
   all shining stars!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Lord, we've given our all to Thee
To be burning in the spirit, to be
   shining forth with Christ.

Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.
 
 2  Oh, how we need the churches,
 2  All of them, great or small!
 2  We need their many portions

 3  Built up in one accord;
 3  This golden testimony
 3  Will thus express the Lord.
 
The churches, the churches,

Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.
 
 4  And soon will be the coming

 4  He's coming for the churches
 4  Where His sweet praises ring.
 4  Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,
 4  As draws the harvest nigh,
 4  And to Thy throne do take us,
 4  To reign with Thee on high.
 
The churches, the churches,
Upon the earth today;
Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  When Noah worked upon the ark as God to him decreed,
 1  So many others watched, yet to his words they gave no heed.
 1  But Noah heard the voice of God and did His word obey;
 1  His business was to build the ark; he couldn't waste a day.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.
 
 2  The generation at that time was evil and perverse;
 2  The wickedness upon the earth was waxing worse and worse.
 2  But Noah stood against the age and ne'er the vision lost.
 2  The ark of testimony must be built at any cost.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.
 
 3  There were at that time many men who said they worshipped God;
 3  They served Him and they sacrificed and yet 'twas very odd,
 3  The very thing that God desired they mocked and ridiculed.
 3  Their heart was set upon this age and by the devil ruled.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.
 
 4  One day the ark was finished and eight souls were led aboard.
 4  God shut the door and then the heavens opened and outpoured.
 4  It rained, but Noah took no thought for he was safe inside.
 4  When all the earth was flooded, he above it all did ride.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.
 
 5  The ark was just God's testimony on the earth that time.
 5  For God had found a corporate man through whom His light could shine.
 5  He needed something built through which He'd fully be expressed,
 5  And now it is the local church where God is manifest.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.
 
 6  Be careful lest this age would lead you from
 6  God's heart's desire.
 6  For Jesus' testimony must set all our hearts afire.
 6  The local churches are the ark, God's testimony true.
 6  For this we leave the age behind and give our hearts anew.
 
Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
The ark of testimony built in each locality.

 1  There in old Chaldea, product of man's fall,
 1  God appeared to Abram - called him from it all.
 1  "Get thee from thy country, from thy father's clan,
 1  Get thee from thy kindred to another land."
 
Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.
 
 2  Through the Lord's infusion, Abraham became
 2  Father of the faithful - life had changed his name.
 2  Though the Lord's appearing, brought him to the land,
 2  Still he needed Isaac to fulfill God's plan.
 
Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.
 
 3  Isaac from his father did inherit all:
 3  Sonship's full enjoyment, blessing of God's call.
 3  Though all things receiving, incomplete was he;
 3  Lacking transformation and maturity.
 
Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.
 
 4  In his father's footsteps, Jacob then became
 4  Prince of God, a wrestler, Israel his name;
 4  By the Spirit's dealing, fully grown, he reigned;
 4  O'er the earth, through Joseph, ruling pow'r obtained.
 
Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.
 
 5  Thus do Jacob, Isaac, Abraham portray
 5  Path that we, God's called ones, must walk in today:
 5  Members of the Body, as a corporate man,
 5  We complete His calling and fulfill His plan.
 
Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.

 1  We are the Hebrews! Praise the Lord!
 1  We're from the other side.
 1  Throughout our hist'ry we have passed
 1  Through rivers deep and wide.
 
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
He has brought
All us river-crossing Hebrews
To the land, to build up
The temple of our God.
 
 2  Old Noah's age was so corrupt,
 2  In deep depravity;
 2  So Noah passed across the flood -
 2  That separating sea.
 
Praise the Lord! He has brought
From the old
To a new recovered region
Where he built in this land
An altar for his God.
 
 3  Then Abraham was called apart,
 3  For God to take a stand;
 3  So through the river he was led
 3  Into a new, good land.
 
Step by step he was led
From Chaldee
Through the river into Canaan,
That good land, there to be
The servant of his God.
 
 4  The Israelites in bondage were
 4  To Pharaoh's choking hand.
 4  The God of Hebrews made a way
 4  For them to leave that land.
 
Through the sea, they all passed;
Egypt fell,
Hallelujah! In the good land
They built up God's own house
To satisfy His heart.
 
 5  Then wand'ring through the wilderness,
 5  The land they could not find;
 5  Till through the Jordan they did pass
 5  To leave themselves behind.
 
Praise the Lord! In the land
They built up
God's own temple. Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord! There they dwelt,
His people and their God.
 
 6  But then religion conquered all,
 6  So John the Baptist came
 6  And buried all beneath that flood.
 6  The Jews were not the same.
 
Buried all! Buried all!
Buried all!
Underneath the Jordan River
Buried all to become
The Hebrews passing through.
 
 7  Now in the church life, we have left
 7  The world, religion too;
 7  Now we're the river-crossing ones,
 7  Enjoying Christ so new!
 
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
We have passed
From the oldness, Hallelujah,
Into Christ - one new man.
And now we're one with Him!
 
 8  O Lord, You've taken us across
 8  The fiery sea of glass,
 8  With all the worldly things beneath;
 8  Across the sea we've passed.
 
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Now we stand
As the Hebrews, Hallelujah,
On the sea! Praise the Lord!
We've passed through everything!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 1  We're the river-crossers, Hebrews is our name;
 1  Crossed the Euphrates, idols all are slain.
 1  Entered into Canaan, left the other side;
 1  Seeking a city, which shall e'er abide.
 
We are the Hebrews, that's our real name;
We've crossed the river, we are not the same.
Building God's house that He may dwell on earth,
Building God's house that He may dwell on earth.
 
 2  We were bound in Egypt, building for the foe;
 2  God of the Hebrews said, "Let My people go!"
 2  We have crossed the Red Sea, reached the other side;
 2  Pharaoh, his army, perished in the tide.
 
God of the Hebrews, speak again today;
God of the Hebrews, lead us all the way.
Save all Your people from this crooked age,
Save all Your people from this crooked age
 
 3  We're released, and now we build the house of God;
 3  His tabernacle is our true abode.
 3  Forty years of oldness left in Jordan's tide,
 3  Fight we for Canaan on the kingdom side.
 
Salvation's Captain sounds the trump of war;
City by city, take we more and more,
To gain His kingdom, enter into rest,
To gain His kingdom, enter into rest.
 
 4  What was once God-given soon a form became;
 4  Then John the Baptist did God's word proclaim -
 4  Make another crossing, God is going on;
 4  Judaism's over; listen to My Son!
 
Turn from the prophets, turn unto the Son;
He's My Beloved, He and I are one;
His Word will save you to the uttermost,
His Word will save you to the uttermost.
 
 5  Now we're overcomers on the sea of glass;
 5  This final crossing will forever last.
 5  Sing the song of Moses, make the praise complete,
 5  Look! All our enemies beneath our feet.
 
We're overcomers, that's our real name.
God has His city; Satan gets the shame.
God is our portion for eternity,
God is our portion for eternity.

 1  The birthright God has giv'n to us
 1  Must be our goal, our highest prize,
 1  For we're the church of the first-born -
 1  Let us our portion realize!
 
 2  A double portion of the land
 2  Was Joseph's birthright - and 'tis ours
 2  If we our garments keep from sin,
 2  And stay pure in temptation's hour.
 
 3  The priesthood was to Levi giv'n
 3  As his inheritance - for he
 3  Did count his family ties but loss
 3  And owned God's things supreme to be.
 
 4  The kingship, Judah did receive
 4  For tending to young Joseph's need;
 4  Through Benjamin's adversity,
 4  He was his comforter indeed.
 
 5  The double portion we would seek,
 5  The priesthood and the kingship too;
 5  Make us so desperate, Lord, for Thee
 5  That Thee, our birthright, we'd pursue.
 
 6  We would be those who pay the price,
 6  Deny the soul, reject the self;
 6  Ambitious for the birthright thus
 6  We'd gain Thee, Lord, above all else.
 
 7  The promise, Lord, 'twas giv'n to us,
 7  Oh, let us ne'er this right despise;
 7  Enflame us, Lord, to gain Thyself,
 7  And Thee, our birthright realize.

 1  Christ has called us once to Him,
 1  But He calls us once again.
 1  To His call we say Amen!
 1     Overcome!
 1  For the church has fallen low,
 1  Thinking everything they know,
 1  But the life is missing; so,
 1     Overcome!
 
Overcome! Overcome!
Overcome degraded Christianity!
All your working lay aside,
All the teachings that divide;
Eat the Lord whate'er betide -
   Overcome!
 
 2  Eating is man's destiny
 2  And the Lord's recovery;
 2  This defeats the enemy -
 2     Overcome!
 2  Come enjoy the tree of life,
 2  Leave the doctrines, leave the strife!
 2  Overcome by eating Christ -
 2     Overcome!
 
Overcome! Overcome!
Overcome degraded Christianity!
All your working lay aside,
All the teachings that divide;
Eat the Lord whate'er betide -
   Overcome!
 
 3  Teachings ne'er transform the soul,
 3  Teachings never reach God's goal,
 3  Eating Christ will do it all -
 3     Overcome!
 3  We must overcome to eat,
 3  By ourselves and when we meet,
 3  Eat Him as the feast complete -
 3     Overcome!
 
Overcome! Overcome!
Overcome degraded Christianity!
All your working lay aside,
All the teachings that divide;
Eat the Lord whate'er betide -
   Overcome!
 
 4  Eating give the manchild birth,
 4  Eating brings the Lord to earth;
 4  Eat Him now midst all the dearth -
 4     Overcome!
 4  Be the manchild Christ requires,
 4  Thus the church that He desires,
 4  Then the Bride that He admires -
 4     Overcome!
 
Overcome! Overcome!
Overcome degraded Christianity!
All your working lay aside,
All the teachings that divide;
Eat the Lord whate'er betide -
   Overcome!

 1  In Revelation two and three,
 1  The seven local churches see:
 1  The lessons there for you and me
 1  Are for the Lord's recovery.
 
 2  The words to them are words to us,
 2  So that the church be glorious,
 2  And all their warnings we must heed
 2  So that the Lord can meet His need.
 
 3  To Ephesus, the word is clear:
 3  "To your first love you're not so near;
 3  You've left to work so far away;
 3  Repent, return to Him today."
 
 4  Thus, we must all turn back to Him,
 4  Leave other loves, for these are sin.
 4  Oh, let us hearken to His call -
 4  If we miss this, we've missed it all!
 
 5  Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore -
 5  "You have been tried, but something more -
 5  Be faithful unto death," we're told
 5  (Not just of body but of soul).
 
 6  Be faithful 'til what's natural dies;
 6  Your circumstances don't despise;
 6  The Lord has sent them all to you
 6  To prove that your first love is true.
 
 7  From Pergamos we clearly see
 7  The world has wed Christianity!
 7  And faithful Antipas did fall -
 7  He dared to stand against it all.
 
 8  To wed the world we all must fear:
 8  His spoken word will save us here -
 8  If to His speaking we give heed,
 8  We'll separated be indeed.
 
 9  Then Thyatira comes at length:
 9  Her mixture with the world her strength.
 9  Fine flour leavened by the yeast,
 9  A harlot riding on a beast.
 
 10  Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;
 10  To us this mixture fully show.
 10  Each added thing we will refute
 10  Until we're wholly absolute.
 
 11  And then from Sardis, we can know
 11  Life is the way that we must go!
 11  She says she's living, but she's dead;
 11  She needs to touch the Lord instead.
 
 12  Lord, take us all the way to life
 12  To overcome the deadness rife.
 12  Away from deadness we would flee
 12  That full of life we'll always be.
 
 13  Now Philadelphia comes at last;
 13  That which she has she should hold fast -
 13  The brothers' love, the name, the word;
 13  This church has satisfied the Lord.
 
 14  We as the brothers all are one;
 14  We're one by life, and life alone.
 14  If we His word and name do keep
 14  A glorious building God will reap.
 
 15  Laodicea warns us all:
 15  From Philadelphia some will fall.
 15  By saying, "I am rich," it's then
 15  The Lord is outside wanting in.
 
 16  Lukewarmness we must ever spurn
 16  And in the spirit always burn,
 16  The inward life experience gain,
 16  And pay the price with Him to reign.
 
 17  Lord, shine Your light on us today
 17  That we may fully go Your way;
 17  Anoint our eyes and let us see
 17  So You can have recovery.

 1  Glorious things of thee are spoken,
 1     Philadelphia, church of love.
 1  These things saith the One who's holy,
 1     He who's real speaks from above;
 1  He that has the key of David,
 1     Who the kingdom's entrance won,
 1  "I will open, no man shutteth" -
 1     He has spoken; it is done.
 
 2  Hallelujah, Philadelphia,
 2     Thine are works that please the Lord.
 2  Strength thou hast, though just a little
 2     And hast kept His living Word.
 2  Thou His holy name denied not,
 2     But confessed it here below -
 2  Lo, a door is set before thee,
 2     Through which none but thee can go.
 
 3  Thou, beloved Philadelphia,
 3     Dost His Word of patience keep.
 3  From the hour of trial He'll save thee,
 3     Which o'er all the world shall sweep.
 3  Troublers too shall know He loves thee;
 3     They to thee must then bow down.
 3  "Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,
 3     That no man may take thy crown."
 
 4  Hallelujah, overcomers,
 4     "In the temple of My God,
 4  I will build them in as pillars,
 4     Nevermore to go abroad."
 4  God's own name is written on them
 4     And the new name of the Lord.
 4  With the triune God they're blended;
 4     They're the city of our God.
 
 5  Hallelujah, out of heaven,
 5     Comes the New Jerusalem:
 5  Gates of pearl and walls of jasper,
 5     Mingled with each precious gem.
 5  Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
 5     Has become His Bride so dear.
 5  Now the Spirit in the churches
 5     Speaks to all who have an ear.

 1  Oh, the Lord is quickly coming,
 1  He has spoken in His Word;
 1  And confirmed it by the churches,
 1  For His Spirit we have heard.
 
 2  Not to all the seven churches

 2  To the church in Philadelphia
 2  Did He choose these words to say.
 
 3  Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
 3  Church so full of brotherly love,
 3  You're the church to bring the Bridegroom
 3  Back to earth from heav'n above.
 
 4  He that hath the key of David,
 4  He that shuts and opens too,
 4  Knows thy works, O Philadelphia;
 4  That's why you're His Bride so true.
 
 5  Not so strong by worldly standards,
 5  Hidden from religion's fame;
 5  Jesus loves you, Philadelphia,
 5  For you're faithful to His name.
 
 6  By His Word you're overcoming -
 6  How the Amen does resound!
 6  Just hold fast to what you've gotten,
 6  That no man may take your crown.
 
 7  You have kept His Word of patience;
 7  He will keep you from that hour
 7  Which upon the whole world cometh
 7  When the Lord comes in His power.
 
 8  "I come quickly," Philadelphia,
 8  Speaks the Lord to none but you;
 8  "Amen! Quickly come, Lord Jesus,"
 8  Answer back His faithful few.

 5     Brotherly love.
 5  To this love God has restored us;
 5  Everything will fall before us;
 5  Love is over all victorious,
 5     Brotherly love!

 1  In the church of Jesus there is love for you,
 1  Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
 1  Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
 1  When the church of Jesus has a full supply?
 
 2  In the church of Jesus there is life for you,
 2  Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
 2  Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
 2  Since the church of Jesus cares for those He bought?
 
 3  In the church of Jesus there is work for you;
 3  Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
 3  Why stand idly sighing for some life work grand,
 3  While the church of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?
 
 4  In the church of Jesus there's a place for you;
 4  Glorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too;
 4  Why then like a wand'rer, roam with weary pace,
 4  If the church of Jesus holds for you a place.

 5  The life of Christ we did obtain,
 5  For holiness the gold we gain.
 5  Holy brothers, glorious!
 
 6  What we are, we're the lampstand;

 6  We're the lampstand, glorious.

 1  We've become the Lord's dear brothers
 1  Through His resurrection pow'r;
 1  He desires many brothers
 1  Sharing in His triumph hour!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!
 
 2  In our Brother's resurrection
 2  Resurrected we must meet,
 2  Never in our natural standing -
 2  This will make His joy complete!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!
 
 3  Every day we must see Jesus
 3  As we're eating of the Word;
 3  Then we'll run to all the meetings
 3  Burning, bubbling with the Lord!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!
 
 4  In the meetings we are feasting
 4  On the food unlimited.
 4  Jesus always satisfies us,
 4  Feeding us the living bread!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!
 
 5  We would satisfy our Brother,
 5  Even though our portion's small.
 5  Every one must share his "new dish"
 5  For the benefit of all!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!
 
 6  Not for message or for speaker,
 6  But to meet the Lord we're here;
 6  Caring only for His presence,
 6  We would see our Brother dear!
 
Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
Him alone to glorify!

 1  All the meetings Christ appointed
 1     And attended here on earth
 1  Were apart from all religion,
 1     All its rituals, forms, and dearth.
 1  Resurrection, not religion,
 1     Must be our reality;
 1  Let us meet in resurrection,
 1     From all dead religion free.
 
 2  When the Lord was resurrected,
 2     All religious things were through;
 2  Christ is now our living temple,
 2     Christ is all our offerings too.
 2  With our Lord in resurrection,
 2     Hallelujah, we're released!
 2  Pity all the old religion -
 2     All our meetings are a feast!
 
 3  Yet religion - oh, how subtle -
 3     In our blood is hiding out;
 3  God must give us revelation,
 3     All that unseen monster rout.
 3  Lord, we still are too religious -
 3     Down with our religious soul!
 3  We would all release our spirit,
 3     Let each meeting reach the goal.
 
 4  In the meetings, in the meetings,
 4     On the mountain, at the shore,
 4  Jesus, Jesus, living Jesus,
 4     He is here - what want we more?
 4  Bury all the old religion,
 4     Even Christianity -
 4  Jesus, Jesus, we have Jesus,
 4     He is our reality!

 1  The faith which once for all was giv'n
 1  Unto the saints of old,
 1  Has been committed unto us
 1  To guard, defend, and hold.
 
And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
Our deposit to that day.
 
 2  This good deposit is the mark
 2  Of God's economy,
 2  Without it we will miss the aim
 2  Of His recovery.
 
And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,

And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
Our deposit to that day.
 
 4  This outline of the healthy words,
 4  In faith and love we'll hold;
 4  All different teaching, fruitless talk,
 4  Reject with spirit bold.
 
And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
Our deposit to that day.
 
 5  Oh, healthful teaching, wholesome words:
 5  The truth of godliness!
 5  Oh, good deposit, common faith,
 5  And life of holiness!
 
And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
Our deposit to that day.
 
 6  Lord, make us now those faithful men
 6  Who pass on what we've heard;
 6  Make us examples of the saints
 6  In spirit, faith, and word.
 
And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
Our deposit to that day.

 1     The Lord has shown the way
 1     Within the church today -
 1  It's laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
 1     Christ is the Canaan land;
 1     In Him we boldly stand,
 1  While laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
 
On to victory! On to victory!
Cries our great Commander - On!
   We'll move at His command
   And now possess the land
Through laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
 
 2     The way that God has planned
 2     To labor on the land
 2  Is "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
 2     Whene'er He speaks today,
 2     Whatever He may say,
 2  It's "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"

Cries our great Commander - On!
   We'll move at His command
   And now possess the land
By "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
 
 3     The Lord has also shown

 3     Where'er the Body goes,
 3     Howe'er the Spirit flows,
 3  It's following, following, following the church.
 
On to victory! On to victory!
Cries our great Commander - On!
   We'll move at His command
   And now possess the land
By following, following, following the church.

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  In Eden's garden, Satan thought
 1  He'd wreck the Lord's intention.
 1  And so, conspiring, then, he wrought
 1  His subtle intervention.
 1  To man he entered in,
 1  Became indwelling sin,
 1  And by this deed so bad
 1  He really thought he had
 1  Undone the Lord completely.
 
 2  'Twas all according to God's plan
 2  To trap the Devil, Satan.
 2  His sphere of moving narrowed now,
 2  Man's flesh his habitation;
 2  Though brilliant was his plan
 2  To enter into man,
 2  This man became instead
 2  The means to bruise his head,
 2  And finish him forever.
 
 3  So Christ put on human flesh -
 3  An act of wisdom purely.
 3  And on the cross did thus enmesh
 3  His foe held so securely.
 3  Though desperate Satan's plight -
 3  He fought with all his might;
 3  But when the morning came
 3  Christ was alive again,
 3  And Satan crushed forever.

 1  O Lord, we've seen Your purpose to bring the many sons
 1  To share in Your full glory and see Your kingdom come.
 1  We praise You, Lord, this glory is You, Yourself within,
 1  Spread out in all Your people to shine in all of them.
 
 2  Since we received Your life, Lord, a seed's been growing there:
 2  The seed of inward glory, the glory we will share!
 2  By growing 'til the blossom of glory blooms in full,
 2  We'll thus enjoy Your increase and glory bountiful.
 
 3  Hail! Captain of Salvation! Our heav'nly Pioneer!
 3  Our praises, midst the battle and tumult, You will hear.
 3  We're following our Captain all through the mighty fray.
 3  Our glorious, faithful Captain sustains us all the way.
 
 4  Lord, fighting on to glory, You now have gone before;
 4  Now fighting in Your footsteps we'll conquer o'er and o'er.
 4  From glory unto glory, we'll fight until we see
 4  The glory from within us shall manifested be.
 
 5  Then, Lord, at last the fighting and battle cry will cease,
 5  And we'll appear in glory, Your kingdom and increase.
 5  That day we'll be completed, that day Your face we'll see,
 5  For in that blessed day, Lord, we'll in the glory be!

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 
 1  At the end of Luke's gospel, chapter twenty and two,
 1  The Lord says to Peter, "Satan wants to sift you,"
 1  But the Lord's interceding and His prayer is true,
 1  Hallelujah! He's prayed for us, we'll never sift through!
 
Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.
 
 2  Just a Christian alone, however strong he may be
 2  Cannot withstand the sifting of the Lord's enemy;
 2  Though he might sift one only, yet he'll ne'er sift two,
 2  Hallelujah! Together we're too big to sift through!
 
Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.
 
 3  What wonderful purpose God has purposed for us,
 3  To be transformed and reigning with His Son, glorious;
 3  So it just doesn't matter what the foe might do -
 3  Hallelujah! The church is much too big to sift through!
 
Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.

 1  An uplifted gospel have we,
 1  One we're not ashamed to proclaim.
 1  Our gospel's the highest of all,
 1  For it is God's goal and God's aim.
 1  No longer so lowly and poor,
 1  We've found that we're God's holy sons.
 1  No more will we preach as before;
 1  Now each man on earth can be won.
 
 2  Our Brother's inherited all

 2  How could men but for Christ decide?

 3  With Christ sitting far above all -
 3  This highest of all gospels yet!

 1  Ours is a fellowship in the gospel
 1     Since we received the Lord;
 1  We're for the furtherance of the gospel,
 1     Spreading to all His Word.
 1  For its defense and strong confirmation
 1     We all partake of grace -
 1  He who began this work will perfect it
 1     Till we shall see His face.
 
 2  May all the things that come to us daily
 2     Unto the gospel turn,
 2  That all may see we're bound for the gospel
 2     And of the Lord may learn.
 2  May we be bold and fearless in spirit,
 2     Speaking the Word of God,
 2  Do it in love and do it in power,
 2     While living in the Lord.
 
 3  Lord, we're expecting that we'll be given

 3  Christ must be magnified in our body

 3  We hope in nothing to be ashamed,
 3     For us to live is Christ -

 4  May all our lives be worthy the gospel
 4     Whatever may betide,
 4  All standing fast in oneness of spirit,
 4     All striving side by side.
 4  Let us proclaim the gospel in fullness
 4     To satisfy the Lord:
 4  Christ is the life, the church His expression,
 4     Sound everywhere abroad.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7 
 
 1  The universe of God consists
 1     Of heaven, earth, and air.
 1  The enemy of God resists
 1     His purpose everywhere.
 1  At first the mighty rebel one
 1     The earth from God obtained;
 1  Then from the Lord the air had won,
 1     Establishing his reign.
 
 2  So God's intention was to gain
 2     His kingdom on the earth,
 2  The place where He could fully reign
 2     And show to all His worth.
 2  Thus He began in Genesis
 2     To forward His great plan.
 2  Out of this darkened, lost abyss
 2     Our God created man.
 
 3  But Satan caused the man to fall
 3     From God's eternal grace.
 3  Then Abraham received the call
 3     To head the chosen race.
 3  The Jews were led from Pharaoh's hand
 3     Through sea and wilderness
 3  Into the promised Canaan land,
 3     God's kingdom to express.
 
 4  The Israelites refused God's reign,
 4     Desired an earthly king;
 4  The kingdom then was lost again
 4     Till David was to bring
 4  God's kingdom back to earth once more
 4     For God to rule through him;
 4  But Israel failed as once before
 4     God's kingdom to bring in.
 
 5  Such was the situation when
 5     Our God became a man,
 5  Declaring to all men, "Repent!
 5     The kingdom is at hand."
 5  A perfect model of God's rule,
 5     The King, full qualified!
 5  But Satan as a desperate fool
 5     Had Jesus crucified.
 
 6  This Jesus went into the grave
 6     And death He overcame.
 6  Now resurrected He will save
 6     The earth from Satan's reign.
 6  He as the Spirit enters man
 6     To fill him with His life.
 6  These men, the church, fulfill His plan
 6     To save the earth from strife.
 
 7  Now on the earth the church we see,
 7     God's kingdom here expressed,
 7  Where He has full authority
 7     His rule to manifest.
 7  The place where Satan has to flee
 7     Our mighty conquering rod,
 7  The kingdom through the church will be
 7     Brought to the earth for God.

From the beachhead in our spirit

Christ will spread through all our being
   And our vessel wholly fill.
He will cast out all rebellion,
   Change our darkness into light.
Satan's kingdom will be swallowed,
   And Christ will reign with might.
This is the Lord's recovery,
   This is His very best!
Brothers, give the Lord the ground in you
   Till His kingdom's manifest.

 1  Chosen by God in ages past,
 1     Our God will never let us go;
 1  Salvation is assured fore'er;
 1     'Tis such security we know.
 
 2  "I give to them eternal life,
 2     They shall not perish," is His word;
 2  "No one shall snatch them from Our hands,"
 2     This is the promise of the Lord.
 
 3  Yet there's a word for God's own sons,
 3     Which is a warning from the Lord:
 3  For those not ready when He comes,
 3     "Worse punishment" and not "reward."
 
 4  Reward is not eternal life,
 4     It's based on how we run the race;
 4  It all depends on what we build,
 4     It's not a matter, here, of grace.
 
 5  'Tis for God's kingdom we press on,
 5     Like Moses, we are for the Lord;
 5  We suffer with God's people here
 5     And look away to the reward.
 
 6  Richer by far, reproach of Christ,
 6     Than Egypt's treasures, which are sin;
 6  By faith we leave Egyptian land,
 6     Avoiding next age discipline.
 
 7  Our soul gained for the kingdom's age -
 7     For this we lose our soul life here;
 7  If we lay down our soul life now,
 7     We'll save it for Christ's kingdom there.
 
 8  We all must learn to pay the price,
 8     Christ must be worked into our soul;
 8  'Tis thus our soul is gained by Him,
 8     This is our aim and this our goal.

 1  Man's Creator has a purpose
 1  For our being here on earth.
 1  In His image we're created,
 1  To express His rule on earth.
 1  But man fell to Satan's tempting;
 1  Thus God's goal was hid from view.
 1  Still our God will have His kingdom,
 1  For His Son will see it through.
 
 2  Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
 2  Notwithstanding Satan's plans;
 2  He's obtaining something real by
 2  Growing in the hearts of man.
 2  Nothing like religion teaches:
 2  "You must wait until you die" -
 2  For the kingdom Christ is building,
 2  Is on earth before our eyes.
 
 3  His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
 3  Once in human form He came.
 3  Now as Spirit He can enter
 3  As the breath of life to man.
 3  As a seed within our spirit
 3  Christ takes root and starts to grow,
 3  Spreading in our inmost being
 3  Till His life we come to know.
 
 4  Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it,
 4  Christ is longing for His Bride.
 4  We can hasten His returning
 4  Simply by the growth in life.
 4  No more struggling, no more striving,
 4  Simply turn to Christ within.
 4  See the seed begin to blossom,
 4  Growing fully into Him.
 
 5  Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
 5  Just by growth - the normal way.
 5  Not an instant transformation;
 5  Growth goes on from day to day.
 5  This life-seed is all-inclusive -
 5  Everything we'll ever need;
 5  Yes, our God's eternal purpose
 5  Is within this precious seed.

 1  The Lord has been revealed in us,
 1  The kingdom-seed so glorious;
 1  He's planted deeper than our heart,
 1  And from us He will ne'er depart.
 1  This seed is never satisfied
 1  Just in our spirits to abide;
 1  He wants to grow and spread today
 1  To live in us in every way.
 
 2  We're like a glove, an empty man,
 2  So meaningless without a hand;
 2  Lord, saturate each inward part
 2  And form Yourself in all our heart.
 2  The Lord must spread into our mind,
 2  Our natural thoughts and concepts bind;
 2  Imaginations, dreams be gone,
 2  The kingdom-seed in us is sown!
 
 3  In our emotions He must grow;
 3  Raw, fragile feelings overthrow;
 3  Our love, our hatred, must be His -
 3  Lord, we agree with You for this.
 3  Another part the Lord must fill -
 3  Our hard, unbending, stubborn will;
 3  Lord, our resistance quickly break,
 3  Subdue us for Thy kingdom's sake.
 
 4  Our conscience too the Lord must clear,
 4  That we may walk in godly fear;
 4  Our conscience must be keen today,
 4  Else we cannot the Lord obey.
 4  'Tis by His growing, spreading thus,
 4  The Lord will have His home in us;
 4  A place on earth where He is Lord,
 4  Full rights to Him we will afford.

His kingdom life be all we know.
Jesus, the kingdom is sown into to us;
Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!
 
 4  But now the kingdom to us has been shown,
 4  It is no less than our Jesus alone.
 4  It is the Person of Christ in us all,
 4  And it begins as a seed when we call.
 
O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
His kingdom life be all we know.
Jesus, the kingdom is sown into to us;
Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5 
 
 
 1  The kingdom of God is at hand:
 1  Ten virgins with lamps lit arise
 1  To go forth to meet the Bridegroom,
 1  But only five virgins are wise.
 1  The wise have abundance of oil,
 1  The foolish are empty instead;
 1  The wise used their time to buy oil,
 1  The others their chance forfeited.
 
 2  Lord Jesus, Thy message is clear:
 2  You're coming for those who are wise,
 2  Who buy up their oil today,
 2  Who deal with all hindering ties.
 2  Those virgins whose souls are transformed,
 2  Whose vessels much oil contain,
 2  Who love not their lives unto death -
 2  They in Thy great kingdom shall reign.
 
 3  Our lamps to shine forth must be trimmed
 3  By calling on Thee every day.
 3  In spirit we must exercise
 3  To burn all the oldness away.
 3  But there is a much deeper need:
 3  Reality in us must grow,
 3  Until it make home in our hearts,
 3  Till oil in our vessels o'erflows.
 
 4  We see how this age is so dark,
 4  We know that blest hour is near.
 4  Our Lord may return anytime -
 4  Lord, strike in us this holy fear,
 4  That we may each moment redeem
 4  By taking Thy Word in by prayer,
 4  By learning each lesson You give,
 4  And thus for that hour prepare.
 
 5  Lord Jesus, how blest to be those
 5  Who bring in Thy kingdom to earth,
 5  Affording Thee rule over all
 5  And showing to all Thy great worth!
 5  How blest to be those at the feast,
 5  Where Thou wilt be one with Thy Bride!
 5  Lord, make us wise virgins for Thee,
 5  Who e'er in Thy presence abide.

 1  Our faith to God-ward must in these days spread abroad.
 1  To show we've turned from idols to the living God.
 1  We'll mix His Word with faith by answering "Amen!"
 1  And to Christ in the Word turn again and again.
 
Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
The labor of our love increase abundantly,
His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.
 
 2  The love for all the brothers, in our midst is found,
 2  But in these days our love must increase and abound.
 2  The Lord direct our hearts into the love of God
 2  And prepare us in full for the day of the Lord.
 
Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
The labor of our love increase abundantly,
His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.
 
 3  Our spirit, soul, and body wholly sanctified -
 3  Our faithful Lord will do it to prepare His Bride,
 3  While we amen His voice in matters great or small,
 3  That we all may be ready to hear Jesus' call.
 
Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
The labor of our love increase abundantly,
His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.
 
 4  The Lord Himself shall come, and we shall be with Him -
 4  Oh, what a glorious hope! Come quickly, Lord, Amen.
 4  We'd ever watchful be to see Thee in the air
 4  And as sons of the day for that meeting prepare.
 
Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
The labor of our love increase abundantly,
His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.

 1  We love Thy coming, Lord!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 1  The day approaches; Jesus soon is coming.
 1  Redeem the time; it must not slip away.
 1  Lord, make us ready for the cry: "Behold Him!"
 1  By using every moment of each day.
 
When Jesus comes, will we go in to meet Him?
When Jesus comes, will we from self have ceased?
He's coming soon to take the wise ones with Him.
Oh, let us not be left outside the feast.
 
 2  Lord, help us to redeem these golden moments;
 2  Our vessels fill with ointment from above;
 2  Help us amen each trial and tribulation;
 2  Increase in us; make us abound in love.
 
He's coming soon - these moments are so precious.
The oil is here - Oh, let us buy the more.
Amen the trials and welcome tribulations -
The kingdom's ours through these afflictions sore.
 
 3  Lord, ever turn us from our soulish pleasures
 3  To gaze upon Thy tender, loving face.
 3  Oh, keep us running forth to meet the Bridegroom
 3  And patiently attending to the race.
 
When Jesus comes, will we be in His presence?
When Jesus comes, will we His face behold?
Oh, let us not return to sloth and folly,
But jealously His loving presence hold.
 
 4  As His dear Bride, let us go forth to meet Him,
 4  Our lamps well-trimmed, our fires burning bright,
 4  Our vessels filled, our eyes set on His glory,
 4  To be with Him completely satisfied.
 
Yes, satisfied - Christ and His Bride together,
Yes, satisfied - throughout eternity.
Oh, what a rest, what joy, what love, what favor
To be His Bride when He comes to His feast!

 1  We have oil in our lamps - we are burning!
 1     We have oil in our lamps today!
 1  To the spirit, O Lord, keep us turning,

O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!

O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!
Turning, turning all the way!

 2  So our vessels we give for the filling

Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
Every moment give us more of Thee!
Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
Fill us with reality!
 
 3  Then we'll burn till the Lord comes to meet us,
 3     Then we'll burn till He comes that day.
 3  Then we'll go in with Him to the wedding

Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come and find us filled and burning bright!
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come and in Thy Bride delight.

 1  Who can tell how soon the Bride may hear the cry,
 1     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 1  Hear the shout of triumph ringing in the sky,
 1     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
 2  Who will have their lamps all trimmed and burning bright?
 2     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 2  Extra oil have ready should you hear tonight,
 2     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
 3  Who will now be washed by water in the Word?
 3     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 3  Spots and wrinkles cleanse before the shout is heard,
 3     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
 4  Who will be the counterpart to Christ today?
 4     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 4  Ready be to match Him now without delay,
 4     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
 5  Who will now be clothed in linen bright and pure?
 5     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 5  Acts of righteousness will make her rapture sure,
 5     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
 6  Hark! As one the Spirit and the Bride doth say,
 6     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 6  Brothers, sisters, this may be the wedding day!
 6     "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
 
We can almost see His glory in the sky;
It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
   "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

 1  In that bright and golden moment when the Christ we love shall come,
 1     And the radiance of His glory we shall see;
 1  When the Bride shall meet the Bridegroom and His loving wife become,
 1     What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!
 
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting any moment we will share!
 
 2  When to all who love His coming He shall speak the word, "Arise!"
 2     Oh, how blessed for that summons to be free!
 2  With what rapture we shall greet Him as we join Him in the skies -
 2     What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!
 
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting any moment we will share!
 
 3  Now in all the local churches we are meeting day by day
 3     And expecting any moment Christ to see,
 3  But when Jesus comes the meeting starts that ne'er will pass away -
 3     What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!
 
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting any moment we will share!
 
 4  Even now while we are meeting, Lord, we hope to see Thy face
 4     And forever without ceasing be with Thee.
 4  Then we'll just go right on meeting in another meeting place -
 4     What a meeting, what a meeting this will be!
 
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
What a meeting, what a meeting,
What a meeting any moment we will share!

 1  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming,
 1     And the time will not be long
 1  Before we hail that wedding morning
 1     And lift up the glad new song.
 
Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
   When the Christ we love shall come;
With vessels filled and lamps all burning
   Let us welcome His return.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
   And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
   And lift up the glad new song.
 
 2  Oh, let us now redeem each moment,
 2     More the precious oil to buy,
 2  And have our vessels filled with ointment
 2     Ere we hear the midnight cry.
 
Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
   When the Christ we love shall come;
With vessels filled and lamps all burning
   Let us welcome His return.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
   And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
   And lift up the glad new song.
 
 3  Oh, what a joy it is preparing
 3     For our wedding with the Lord,
 3  E'en in the tribulations sharing
 3     For the bliss of such reward!
 
Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
   When the Christ we love shall come;
With vessels filled and lamps all burning
   Let us welcome His return.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
   And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
   And lift up the glad new song.
 
 4  Oh, with what rapture and rejoicing
 4     Shall the wedding day begin;
 4  And then a thousand years of dining
 4     At the marriage feast with Him!
 
Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
   When the Christ we love shall come;
With vessels filled and lamps all burning
   Let us welcome His return.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
   And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
   And lift up the glad new song.

 1  Our Bridegroom soon is coming
 1     To claim His holy Bride,
 1  The ones whom He has wooed, won,
 1     And wholly sanctified.
 1  O Lord, we would be ready
 1     And get our hearts in tune
 1  For the wedding day that's coming
 1        Very soon.
 
Oh, the wedding day is coming,
   Is coming very soon,
When the Bride shall be prepared
   And shall marry her Bridegroom.
Oh, what love and consecration
   Should all our hearts attune
For that wedding day that's coming
      Very soon.
 
 2  Oh, that fine linen garment
 2     Which on that day we'll wear
 2  E'en now, Lord, work within us
 2     And stitch by stitch prepare.
 2  For this we would redeem
 2     Every moment opportune
 2  For the wedding day that's coming
 2        Very soon.
 
Oh, the wedding day is coming,
   Is coming very soon,
When the Bride shall be prepared

Oh, what love and consecration
   Should all our hearts attune
For that wedding day that's coming

 3  Lord, may Your portion in us
 3     Continually increase
 3  That we may be invited
 3     Unto that wedding feast.
 3  And keep us always watching -
 3     At morning, night, or noon -
 3  For the wedding day that's coming
 3        Very soon.
 
Oh, the wedding day is coming,
   Is coming very soon,

Oh, what love and consecration

 1  When our Lord comes in glory and we're raptured to His side,
 1  When that bright and glorious moment we shall see,
 1  We shall know our dear Bridegroom as He comes to take His Bride,
 1  And He'll know the Bride He's loved so tenderly.
 
We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
He shall know us! He shall know us!
We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!
 
 2  Even now in the Spirit He reveals Himself to us,
 2  And His Person dear we've learned to recognize.
 2  But our eyes shall behold Him - O what rapture glorious
 2  When we gaze on Him unveiled in the skies!
 
We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
He shall know us! He shall know us!
We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!
 
 3  In the Word we have seen Him shining forth in truth and grace,
 3  O how blessed to behold His features thus!
 3  But the day soon is coming when we'll see Him face to face,
 3  He, the living Word, in full revealed to us.
 
We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
He shall know us! He shall know us!
We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!
 
 4  In the brothers and sisters, O how blest to see the Lord,
 4  In their attitudes and actions Christ expressed!
 4  But the day soon is coming when in rapturous accord
 4  We shall see His Person fully manifest.
 
We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
He shall know us! He shall know us!
We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!
 
 5  In the meetings of the churches He's unveiled increasingly -
 5  O the joy unspeakable and glory too!
 5  As the meetings grow higher we're expecting soon to see
 5  The full glory of our Lord come into view.
 
We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
He shall know us! He shall know us!
We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!

Verses:  1   2   3   4 
 
 
 1  'Twas a day in early springtime,
 1  By an ancient wayside well,
 1  Eliezer paused to rest his camel train.
 1  He had found a bride for Isaac
 1  Ere the evening shadows fell,
 1  For his weary journey had not been in vain.
 
Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
There's going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.
 
 2  So he took the fair Rebekah,
 2  Dressed in jewels rich and rare,
 2  Quickly to her waiting bridegroom far away.
 2  Where Rebekah loved her Isaac,
 2  And he loved Rebekah fair;
 2  Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day.
 
Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
There's going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.
 
 3  Now the blessed Holy Spirit,
 3  From our Father God above,
 3  Has come down to earth to find a worthy Bride.
 3  For our Isaac over yonder
 3  Has prepared His tents of love,
 3  And He wants His fair Rebekah by His side.
 
Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
There's going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.
 
 4  We have left our kinfolk gladly;
 4  We have bade the world goodbye.
 4  We've been called to be His pure and spotless Bride;
 4  Where we'll soon behold our Jesus
 4  In that blest eternity -
 4  What a happy, happy wedding that will be!
 
Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
There's going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
In the evening when the camel train comes in.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 1  The grace which God bestows on us
 1  Is just His Son in full;
 1  The rich enjoyment of this Christ
 1  Is plenteous, bountiful.
 1  'Tis far too great to comprehend,
 1  Too wondrous to contain:
 1  How we, once children of despair,
 1  God's masterpiece became.
 
 2  The whole creation now beneath
 2  The weight of bondage sore,
 2  In seeing God's sons manifest
 2  Is freed forevermore.
 2  Th' eternal purpose of our God
 2  Will be full manifest;
 2  The hope of glory now concealed
 2  Is then to all expressed.
 
 3  The briars will be myrtle trees,
 3  The thorn will be no more,
 3  And peace will reign where war did rage,
 3  The curse will then be o'er.
 3  'Tis then the trees shall clap their hands,
 3  And all the hills shall sing;
 3  This glorious freedom shall God's sons
 3  Thus manifested bring.
 
 4  God's deepest work of grace goes on
 4  Each day, though hidden, small,
 4  Until that day, when manifest,
 4  It is revealed to all.
 4  By then God's wrought His finished work:
 4  Himself dispensed to us;
 4  And all creation 'round admires
 4  His product, glorious.
 
 5  The angels that before our God
 5  In brightest splendor stand,
 5  Will join the universal praise
 5  To Him for all He's planned.
 5  And of the devil, of his end . . . ?
 5  We'll praise the Lord for how
 5  Just distant smoke is all that's left
 5  Of all that troubles now.
 
 6  So shall we not delight to give
 6  Ourselves in every way,
 6  And let the Lord dispense Himself
 6  Into us more each day;
 6  The grace that we receive each day,
 6  Though hidden oft, and small,
 6  Is God Himself wrought into us,
 6  That day to shine o'er all.

 1  In spirit, in the church we see
 1  The high estate we're destined for.
 1  It's higher, vaster, more profound
 1  Than anything we've seen before.
 
 2  It's not a view in doctrine bare
 2  But an unveiling of the Christ.
 2  He's marvelous and far beyond
 2  Our mental thought or power to share.
 
 3  He's rich, unlimited, profound,
 3  Immeasurable, and marvelous.
 3  Yet 'tis a greater wonder still
 3  He needs heirs of salvation - us.
 
 4  God has accomplished many things -
 4  He's planned, created, and brought forth.
 4  The Son is now appointed Heir,
 4  Administrator of God's worth.
 
 5  But in th' economy of God
 5  There is not one, but many sons.
 5  One is the firstborn Son of God
 5  With many other living ones.
 
 6  Christ will inherit all God's things,
 6  And we're the heirs of God with Christ.
 6  We're growing now to be matured;
 6  As heirs we'll soon be legalized.
 
 7  We're joint-heirs with the firstborn Son,
 7  Inheriting the universe.
 7  We're in this corporation vast -
 7  All partners of Christ and the church.
 
 8  In spirit, in the church, we see
 8  Our calling of unrivaled worth.
 8  We're destined, not to go to heaven.
 8  We're destined to be kings on earth.
 
 9  We're paupers, yet we're glorious kings.
 9  Inheriting the kingdom vast,
 9  The earth, God's throne, and e'en all things
 9  And all the Father is and has.

 1  The voice of my Beloved,
 1  Behold, He quickly comes;
 1  He leaps upon the mountains,
 1  And o'er the hills He runs.
 1  The signs of His appearing
 1  Are seen on every side;
 1  The Bridegroom soon is coming
 1  To claim His loving Bride.
 
 2  How real that He is coming -
 2  Come quickly, Lord, again!
 2  We watch for His appearing,
 2  His precious Word amen.
 2  Oh, don't delay His coming,
 2  Pray without ceasing, pray;
 2  He's eagerly awaiting
 2  That coming wedding day.
 
 3  He longs to hear our voices,
 3  He longs to see our face -
 3  Our voices filled with sweetness,
 3  Our countenance with grace.
 3  "Arise, My love, My fair one,"
 3  We long to hear Him say.
 3  The voice of our Beloved -
 3  "Arise and come away!"
 
 4  The winter rain is over,
 4  The flowers appear on earth;
 4  The rising sun of Jesus
 4  Fills all our hearts with mirth.
 4  It is the time of singing,
 4  The turtle dove is heard;
 4  For our Beloved's coming
 4  The sweetest chords are stirred.
 
 5  Oh, let us take the foxes
 5  That spoil the blooming vine;
 5  Our vineyards are in blossom,
 5  And all, Beloved, is Thine.
 5  The day is quickly dawning,
 5  The shadows flee away;
 5  Upon the mount of spices
 5  Our Lord may come today.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
 
 1  Our God is a God of purpose,
 1  What He plans, He will fulfill!
 1  Genesis to Revelation
 1  Shows His full and glorious will.
 1  What He's after is a building.
 1  In creation He began
 1  With a simple garden planted -
 1  This, the setting for His plan.
 
 2  Man was made, the first step God took
 2  To achieve His final goal,
 2  As a vessel, a container,
 2  Three parts - body, spirit, soul.
 2  God, of dust, a body formed him,
 2  Breath of life into him breathed -
 2  This part is man's human spirit
 2  By which God may be received.
 
 3  In the garden God had planted
 3  Every tree He made to grow,
 3  Good for food, to sight most pleasing,
 3  And the tree of life also!
 3  Second, then, in God's intention
 3  Was that man should freely eat
 3  Of the life-tree in the center
 3  To obtain His life complete.
 
 4  Third, we see a river flowing,
 4  Out of Eden coming forth,
 4  With its flow in four directions -
 4  East and west and south and north.
 4  As on Christ our life we're feeding,
 4  Living water in us flows.
 4  Hallelujah for this river
 4  And the watering it bestows!
 
 5  In the flowing of the river
 5  Gold, pearl, onyx stone we see;
 5  Three materials, raw yet precious,
 5  For God's building meant to be.
 5  Look, these elements are shining!
 5  How can we, then, shine as they?
 5  Simply by the Lord, the Spirit,
 5  Us transforming every day.
 
 6  God the Father (in this fourth step),
 6  Source of life, is gold divine;
 6  Christ the Son was wounded by us
 6  To produce the pearl so fine.
 6  God the Spirit brings the stones forth -
 6  Transformation of the clay.
 6  By the flowing of the Spirit
 6  Changed we'll be from day to day.
 
 7  Insufficient are materials
 7  Precious though they be and best;
 7  These must be built up together
 7  That God's house they may express.
 7  Fifth step: We ourselves hand over
 7  To the building that we be
 7  Built into God's house, His dwelling,
 7  One in each locality.
 
 8  Finally, in Revelation,
 8  Is the picture of Christ's Bride -
 8  Consummation of God's purpose;
 8  He is fully satisfied.
 8  New Jerusalem, a city,
 8  Is the Bridegroom's counterpart -
 8  So the church built up together
 8  Forms the Bride for Christ's own heart.
 
 9  How can we, as those who truly
 9  Long to see God reach His goal,
 9  Be united and related?
 9  By denial of our soul!
 9  As we contact Christ in spirit,
 9  Feed on Him as life to us,
 9  Then His life will flow, transform us
 9  To His Bride, all glorious!

 1  God eternal has a purpose,
 1  Formed in His eternal past,
 1  Spreading to eternal future;
 1  'Twixt these ends all time is cast.
 1  For with time there is the process,
 1  Time for His accomplishment;
 1  And in time we're merely travelers -
 1  For eternity we're meant.
 
 2  God would have a group of people
 2  Built together in His plan,
 2  Blended, knit, coordinated
 2  As His vessel - one new man.
 2  God would come into this vessel
 2  With His nature, life and ways,
 2  Mingling Spirit with our spirits
 2  For His joy and to His praise.
 
 3  God has worked in three directions
 3  For His plan so marvelous:
 3  As the Father, Son, and Spirit
 3  To dispense Himself to us!
 3  All creation gives the setting -
 3  Heav'n and earth are for this plan;

 4  Makes our spirit one with His.
 4  From the center to circumference
 4  God would saturate each part;
 4  Feeling, mind, and will renewing,
 4  Making home in all our heart.
 
 5  Thus in life we're built together,
 5  Then in love we're knit as one;
 5  God is now His plan fulfilling,
 5  Finishing what He's begun.
 5  Lord, increase Thyself within us
 5  That we might be built by Thee
 5  Into that great corporate vessel
 5  Filled with God exclusively.
 
 6  As the product, the fulfillment,
 6  Will the church in glory stand,
 6  Consummation of the purpose
 6  In eternal ages planned.
 6  God will have His corporate vessel,
 6  All his glory to contain;
 6  Lord, we're wholly for Thy purpose
 6  All Thy goal in us attain.

What is living all about,
Where's the answer? Let's find out!
 
Call, "Lord Jesus!" Taste and see!
Christ becomes reality,
Life He gives abundantly
As a river flowing free.
With a new life we begin,
Joy is springing from within,
Love - He fills us to the brim!
And it's all because of Him! (Hallelujah)

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  Once I thirsted for a fountain,
 1  Something deep that would satisfy,
 1  But the fountain that I'd drink from,
 1  Left me searching and still so dry.
 1  Then one day I found Him,
 1  He satisfied my thirst,
 1  Became in me a deeper source
 1  Whence living waters burst.
 1  Now I drink Him!
 1  Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
 1  Jesus, Jesus is my life;
 1  I'm fully satisfied now,
 1  Jesus, Jesus is my life.
 
 2  After tasting such a fountain,
 2  Longed my heart for a place of springs;
 2  Caught a vision on a mountain,
 2  In Jerusalem's a gathering.
 2  Then one day He found me,
 2  He brought me to the church,
 2  Pleasures here abound fore'er
 2  I've given up my search.
 2  Hallelujah!
 2  Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
 2  Jesus, Jesus is my life;
 2  I'm fully satisfied now,
 2  Jesus, Jesus is my life.
 
 3  Empty wanderer drop the striving -
 3  Isn't worth all the troublin';
 3  Open up your heart believing,
 3  Call "Lord Jesus" and He'll come in!
 3  Then today you'll find Him,
 3  And calling on His name,
 3  You're joined to Him, you're one with Him -
 3  You'll never be the same.
 3  You won't want to!
 3  Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
 3  Jesus, Jesus is my life;
 3  I'm fully satisfied now,
 3  Jesus, Jesus is my life.

 1  My wandering days grew increasingly empty
 1  As I searched for the way,
 1  Just to fill this gap inside me -
 1  Found my seeking vain.
 
 2  Though all this dark earth would convince me life's worthwhile,
 2  Inside all my mirth
 2  Was a cry for something real.
 2  Don't you lie to me, world!
 
For my heart tells me different
When I hear of contentment
Deep within a lack knew better
Why not be honest, world!
 
 3  A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story
 3  Of a man they called Lord;
 3  Yet my heart ne'er ceased to wonder,
 3  Is He really Lord?
 
 4  A search in His Word found my hardened heart softened,
 4  And earth's vanities faded.
 4  In the brightness of His presence
 4  Jesus came into me.
 
Now we're always together
Growing into God's fullness.
O Lord Jesus, how I love You!
You brought life into me.

Verses:  1   2   3   4   5   6 
 
 
 1  The wedding feast, the peak of man's enjoyment
 1  Was full of pleasure till the wine ran dry.
 1  The human life, like wine, is soon exhausted,
 1  Till Jesus comes, divine life to supply.
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.
 
 2  One night a moral righteous man, a ruler
 2  To Jesus came, more teaching to pursue;
 2  But teachings ne'er could change the fallen nature,
 2  So Jesus said, "You must be born anew."
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.
 
 3  "I have no husband," sighed the thirsty sinner.
 3  Indeed her many husbands left her dry.
 3  Daily she came to draw the failing water
 3  Till Jesus came, her thirst to satisfy.
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.
 
 4  A man among the multitude lay helpless,
 4  So weak while waiting till the water stirred.
 4  Religion of the law could never heal him;
 4  Then Jesus came and spoke the living word.
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.
 
 5  Within the tomb, four days and nights he lay there,
 5  Death's grip had come; they 'round the grave did weep.
 5  Silent he lay, all bound and wrapped in grave clothes;
 5  Then Jesus came, and woke him from his sleep.
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.
 
 6  And still today, this Jesus is so living,
 6  Able to save from death in any form.
 6  Now open up your heart and call upon Him;
 6  To you He'll come, in spirit you'll be born.
 
When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
He touches death - it's turned to life eternal,
Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

 1  Do you know that you were chosen
 1  Long before the world began;
 1  That by God you were selected
 1  And appointed for His plan?
 1  Something in your inmost being
 1  Tells you this is surely true;
 1  That's why you are in this meeting,
 1  And you feel the way you do.
 
 2  All the sins you've e'er committed,
 2  Everything you've ever done,
 2  All by God has been forgiven,
 2  Taken care of by God's Son.
 2  Struggle not, no; just believe this,
 2  For His word assures it's true;
 2  All you need to do is thank Him
 2  For all that He's done for you.
 
 3  Did you know that all the Bible
 3  Is a will, a testament?
 3  Everything that Christ accomplished
 3  Is for all God's children meant.
 3  As His child you are included,
 3  For His word stands fast and true;
 3  So by faith you now inherit
 3  All that He has done for you.
 
 4  Did you know God has a family?
 4  Yes, He does, in fact, it's us.
 4  That's why we are here enjoying
 4  All He is, so marvelous.
 4  He's our God and we're His people,
 4  Day by day we love Him more;
 4  We're so happy and so thankful,
 4  We just praise Him o'er and o'er.
 
 5  All we know is that we love Him,
 5  We're so glad for what He's done;
 5  We are brought to Him, and we all
 5  Know the joy of being one.
 5  We're so glad that we're included,
 5  What a fellowship have we!
 5  So we'd like to welcome you, friend,
 5  Into God's own family.

 1  What a happy day
 1  When I no more could turn away,
 1  When Jesus took my heart from the black of night
 1  Into the kingdom of His light.
 
 2  Now my life's begun,
 2  The "really life" that's in the Son.
 2  No more am I enthralled by earth's empty dreams;
 2  Deep in me flows a living stream.
 
 3  As I turn to Him
 3  He fills me with His life within.
 3  His life becomes my life in reality;
 3  Oh, hallelujah, He's in me!

 4  With other loves, You break the cord.
 4  You'll be my life for all eternity;
 4  You are the only One for me.

 1  We were like them that dream.
 
 2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
 2  And our tongue with singing:
 2  Then said they among the nations,
 2  The Lord hath done great things,
 2  The Lord hath done great things for them.
 
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.
 
 3  Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams,
 3  As the streams in the south,
 3  As the streams in the south.
 
 4  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,
 4  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
 
 5  He that goeth forth and weepeth,
 5  Bearing precious seed, shall doubtless,
 5  Come again with rejoicing,
 5  Come again with rejoicing,
 5  Bringing his sheaves with him.
 
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.

Or who has first given to Him,
And it will be repaid to Him?
Because out of Him and through Him
   And to Him are all things.
To Him be the glory forever. Amen.

Now is come salvation and strength
   And the kingdom of our God
   And the authority of His Christ:
For the accuser of our brethren is cast down
Which accused them before our God day and night.
 
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
   And by the word of their testimony
And they loved not their soul lives unto death.
   Therefore rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!

Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people,
And God Himself shall be with them and be their God.
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain,
For the former things are passed away.
Behold, I make all things new.

 1  What miracle! What mystery!
 1  That God and man should blended be!
 1  God became man to make man God,
 1  Untraceable economy!
 1  From His good pleasure, heart's desire,
 1  His highest goal attained will be.
 
 2  Flesh He became, the first God-man,
 2  His pleasure that I God may be:
 2  In life and nature I'm God's kind,
 2  Though Godhead's His exclusively.
 2  His attributes my virtues are;
 2  His glorious image shines through me.
 
 3  No longer I alone that live,
 3  But God together lives with me.
 3  Built with the saints in the Triune God,
 3  His universal house we'll be,
 3  And His organic Body we
 3  For His expression corp'rately.
 
 4  Jerusalem, the ultimate,
 4  Of visions the totality;
 4  The Triune God, tripartite man -
 4  A loving pair eternally -
 4  As man yet God they coinhere,
 4  A mutual dwelling place to be;
 4  God's glory in humanity
 4  Shines forth in splendor radiantly!

God's eternal economy is to make man the same as He is
In life and nature but not in the Godhead
And to make Himself one with man and man one with Him,
Thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression,
That all His divine - that all His divine -
Attributes may be expressed in human virtues.

Verses:  1   2   3 
 
 1  Christ has come to be life, the processed divine Trinity.
 1  God the Father's the source, a fountain emerging to be.
 1  God the Son as a gushing up spring,
 1  In the Spirit a river for life imparting.
 1  Oh, how can this miracle be? The Triune God flowing in me!
 1  Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
 1  I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
 
As this life flows through me, I'm supplied abundantly.
His life nullifies sin!
Power springs now from within!
To be free, overcoming spontaneously.
 
 2  Yet this life though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.
 2  God is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.
 2  So this life has a totality, a consummate issue encompassing me.
 2  Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows
 2  Now I share in this life's destiny.
 2  Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
 2  I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
 
We'll abide mutually, God and man revealed to be
Lamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.
Come! Drink! And riverside,
Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!
 
 3  So I've no cause to frown as one who's received this zoe.
 3  I know life runs its course and triumphs inevitably.
 3  I'm required just to stay in the flow,
 3  If I do the drinking then God gives the growth.
 3  So there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,
 3  And a smile on my face as I sing,
 3  Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
 3  I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
