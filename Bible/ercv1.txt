The Background - No Rain from Heaven, No Man on the Ground, No Life in the Field,#DESCTEXT#Only a Mist from the Earth#VERSTEXT#{gnbDa}These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were {gnbDb}created. {gnbDc}When {gnbDd}Jehovah God {gnbDb}made earth and heaven,</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And no {gnbE-A}plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to {gnbEaB}work the ground,</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground -</VERSE>
		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#2. The First Step - Creating Man as a Vessel to Contain God as Life#VERSTEXT#Jehovah God {gnbGa}formed {gnbGb}man from the {gnbGcA}dust of the {gnbGd}ground and breathed into his nostrils the {gnbGeB}breath of life, and man became a living {gnbGfC}soul.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#3. The Second Step - Having Man Receive God as Life#DESCTEXT#a. Placing Man in Front of the Tree of Life#VERSTEXT#And Jehovah God planted a {gnbH-A}garden in {gnbHa}Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is {gnbIa}pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the {gnbIbA}tree of life in the middle of the garden and the {gnbIcB}tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#b. Putting Man in the Garden with Its River#VERSTEXT#And a {gnbJaA}river went {gnbJb}forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became {gnbJc}four {gnbJd}branches.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of {gnbK-A}Havilah, where there is gold.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the {gnbLa}gold of that land is good; {gnbLa}{gnbL-A}bdellium and {gnbLa}{gnbL-B}onyx stone are there.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Cush.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the name of the third river is {gnbN-A}Hiddekel; it is the one that goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah God took the man and {gnbOa}put him in the garden of Eden to {gnbOb}work it and to {gnbOc}keep it.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#c. Allowing Man to Have Free Choice#VERSTEXT#And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, {gnbP-A}Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely,</VERSE>

		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#4. The Third Step - Working God into Man as Life to Be His Complement#DESCTEXT#a. Man, Typifying God, Needing to Have a Complement#VERSTEXT#And Jehovah God said, It is not {gnbR-A}good for the {gnbRa}man to be alone; I will make him a {gnbR-B}helper as his {gnbRb}counterpart.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Now Jehovah God had formed {gnbS-A}from the ground every animal of the field and every bird of heaven. And He brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called any living animal, that was its name.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was {gnbTa}not found a helper as his counterpart.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#b. Man Gaining a Complement in and by Life#VERSTEXT#And Jehovah God caused a {gnbUaA}deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his {gnbUb}ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah God {gnbVaA}built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a {gnbVb}woman and {gnbVc}brought her to the man.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the man said, This time this is {gnbW-A}bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh; / This one shall be called {gnbWa}Woman / Because {gnbW-B}out of {gnbWb}Man this one was taken.</VERSE>

		<VERSE>#DESCTEXT#Author: Moses (Mark 12:26 and Luke 20:37, quoting Exo. 3:6; Mark 7:10, quoting Exo. 20:12), the author of the five books of the Law (Deut. 31:9, 24; Luke 24:27, 44; John 1:45; 5:46; Acts 28:23; 2 Cor. 3:15).#DESCTEXT#Time of Writing: Approximately 1490 B.C. (cf. 1 Kings 6:1) in the second year after the exodus, after the tabernacle was erected (40:17).#DESCTEXT#Place of Writing: In the wilderness and at Mount Sinai (19:1-2; 34:27-29).#DESCTEXT#Time Period Covered: From approximately 1706 B.C., when Jacob came to Egypt (1:1), until one year after the exodus from Egypt (40:17) in 1490 B.C. Most of the book covers a period of about one year (12:2; 19:1; 40:17).#DESCTEXT#Subject:#DESCTEXT#Christ Is the Redemption, Salvation, and Supply of God's People and the Means for Them to Worship and Serve God So That in Him They May Be Built Up with God Together for Them and God to Meet, Communicate, and Dwell Mutually#DESCTEXT#I. Enslaved#VERSTEXT#{exaAa}Now these are the {exaA-A}names of the sons of Israel who came to {exaAb}Egypt with Jacob; each man came with his household:</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And all the {exaEa}persons who came forth from the loins of Jacob were {exaE-A}seventy {exaEa}persons, but Joseph was already in Egypt.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Joseph {exaFaA}died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But the children of Israel were {exaG-A}fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was filled with them.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And a {exaH-A}new king rose up over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he said to his people, The people of the children of Israel are now more numerous and {exaI-A}stronger than we.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Come, let us deal {exaJ-A}wisely with them, lest they multiply and, when some war occurs, they also join themselves to those who hate us and fight against us and go up from the land.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So they set taskmasters over them to {exaK-A}afflict them with their {exaK-B}burdens. And they built storage cities for Pharaoh, {exaKa}Pithom and {exaKa}{exaK-C}Raamses.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But the more they afflicted them, the more they {exaL-A}multiplied and the more they spread out so that they came to dread the children of Israel.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness,</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And they made their lives bitter with {exaN-A}hard labor in {exaNa}mortar and in {exaNa}brick and in all kinds of labor in the field; all their labor with which they made them serve was with harshness.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one whose name was Shiphrah and the other whose name was Puah;</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he said, {exaP-A}When you act as midwives for the Hebrew women and see them on the {exaPa}birthstool, if it is a {exaPb}son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a {exaPb}daughter, then she shall live.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But the midwives {exaQa}feared God and {exaQ-A}did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them but let the male children live.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and let the male children live?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous: before the midwife comes to them, they give birth.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very strong.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And because the midwives feared God, He established households for them.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every {exaV-A}son who is {exaVa}born you shall cast into the {exaVb}River, but every daughter you shall let live.</VERSE></CHAPTER>

		<VERSE>And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine child, she {exbBa}hid him {exbB-A}three months.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a papyrus basket and plastered it with tar and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the River.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And his {exbD-A}sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the River while her maidens walked alongside the River. And she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds and sent her female servant, and she brought it to her.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And she opened it and saw the child, and there was the boy, crying. And she had compassion on him and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse from the Hebrew women for you that she may nurse the child for you?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and {exbI-A}nursed him.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her {exbJ-A}son. And she called his name {exbJa}Moses and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>{exbK-A}And in those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and looked on their {exbK-B}burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one there, he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he went out the next day, and there were two Hebrew men struggling together; and he said to the one who was in the wrong, Why are you beating your companion?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he said, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you thinking to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses became {exbNa}frightened and said, Surely the matter is known.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Now when Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses {exbO-A}fled from Pharaoh to dwell in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses rose up and helped them and watered their flock.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why have you come back so quickly today?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew water for us as well and watered the flock.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to eat a meal.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Moses agreed to {exbUa}stay with the man, and he gave Moses {exbU-A}Zipporah his daughter.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And she bore a son, and he called his name {exbVaA}Gershom, for he said, I have been a {exbV-B}sojourner in a foreign land.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And in the course of those many days the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned because of the {exbW-A}bondage. And they cried out, and their {exbW-B}cry went up to God because of their bondage.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And God {exbX-A}heard their groaning, and God {exbX-B}remembered His {exbX-C}covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And God {exbY-A}looked upon the children of Israel, and God took notice of them.</VERSE></CHAPTER>

		<VERSE>#CHAPTEXT#EXODUS 3#DESCTEXT#B. God's Calling of the Prepared One#VERSTEXT#Now {excAa}Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness and came to the {excA-A}mountain of God, to Horeb.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>{excB-A}And the {excBaB}Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a {excBb}flame of fire out of the midst of a {excBb}{excB-C}thornbush. And when he looked, there was the thornbush, burning with fire; but the thornbush was not consumed.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Moses said, I must turn aside now and see this great sight, why the thornbush does not burn up.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And when Jehovah saw that he had turned aside to look, God {excD-A}called to him out of the midst of the {excD-B}thornbush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And He said, Do not come near here. Remove your {excE-A}sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is {excE-B}holy ground.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And He said, I am the God of your father, the {excFaA}God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the {excG-A}affliction of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their {excG-B}taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And I have {excH-A}come down to {excHaB}deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to {excHa}{excH-C}bring them up out of that land to a {excH-D}good and spacious land, to a land flowing with {excHbE}milk and honey, to the place of the {excH-F}Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And now the {excI-A}cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the {excI-B}oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So come now, and I will {excJ-A}send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But Moses said to God, {excKaA}Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And He said, Surely I will be {excL-A}with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this {excLa}mountain.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Then Moses said to God, If I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And God said to Moses, {excNaA}I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, {excN-B}I AM has sent me to you.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And God also said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, {excOa}Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of {excO-A}Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My {excO-B}name forever, and this is My {excO-C}memorial from generation to generation.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Go, and gather the {excP-A}elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the {excP-B}God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely {excP-C}visited you and seen what is being done to you in Egypt.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And I say, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the {excQ-A}Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with {excQ-B}milk and honey.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And they will listen to your voice. And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, {excR-A}Jehovah, the God of the {excRa}Hebrews, has met with us; and now let us go a {excRb}three days' journey into the wilderness that we may {excR-B}sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>But I know that the king of Egypt will {excS-A}not let you go unless compelled by a {excS-B}mighty hand.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My {excT-A}wonders which I will perform in the midst of it, and after that he will {excT-B}let you go.</VERSE>

		<VERSE>And you shall {exdO-A}speak to him and {exdO-B}put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as {exdP-A}God to him.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And you shall take in your hand this {exdQ-A}staff, with which you shall perform the signs.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law. And he said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who were {exdS-A}seeking your life have died.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So Moses took his wife and his {exdT-A}sons, and mounted them upon a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the {exdT-B}staff of God in his hand.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah said to Moses, When you go to return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the {exdU-A}wonders which I have put in your power; but I will {exdU-B}harden his heart, and he will {exdU-C}not let the people go.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, Israel is My {exdV-A}son, My {exdVaB}firstborn.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And I said to you, Let My son go that he may {exdW-A}serve Me; but you have refused to let him go. I will now {exdW-B}slay your son, your {exdW-C}firstborn.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And at the lodging place on the way, Jehovah came upon him and sought to put him to death.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>Then {exdY-A}Zipporah took a flint and {exdYa}cut off her son's foreskin and cast it at Moses' feet, and she said, You are indeed a {exdYb}bridegroom of blood to me!</VERSE>
		<VERSE>So He let him alone. It was then that she said, A bridegroom of blood, because of the circumcision.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to {exdBA-A}meet Moses. And he went and came upon him at the {exdBA-B}mountain of God, and he kissed him.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Moses told Aaron all the {exdBB-A}words of Jehovah with which He had sent him and all the signs with which He had charged him.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the {exdBC-A}elders of the children of Israel.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs in the sight of the people.</VERSE>
		<VERSE>And the people {exdBE-A}believed; and when they heard that Jehovah had {exdBE-B}visited the children of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, they {exdBE-C}bowed and worshipped.</VERSE></CHAPTER></BOOK>
